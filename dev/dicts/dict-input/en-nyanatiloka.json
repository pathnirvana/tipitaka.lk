        "අනත්තා",
        "'not-self', non-ego, egolessness, impersonality, is the last of the three characteristics of existence (<i>ti-lakkhaṇa</i>, q.v.) The <i>anattā </i>doctrine teaches that neither within the bodily and mental phenomena of existence, nor outside of them, can be found anything that in the ultimate sense could be regarded as a self-existing real ego-entity, soul or any other abiding substance. This is the central doctrine of Buddhism, without understanding which a real knowledge of Buddhism is altogether impossible. It is the only really specific Buddhist doctrine, with which the entire Structure of the Buddhist teaching stands or falls. All the remaining Buddhist doctrines may, more or less, be found in other philosophic systems and religions, but the <i>anattā</i>-doctrine has been clearly and unreservedly taught only by the Buddha, wherefore the Buddha is known as the <i>anattā-vādi</i>, or 'Teacher of Impersonality'. Whosoever has not penetrated this impersonality of all existence, and does not comprehend that in reality there exists only this continually self-consuming process of arising and passing bodily and mental phenomena, and that there is no separate ego-entity within or without this process, he will not be able to understand Buddhism, i.e. the teaching of the 4 Noble Truths (<i>sacca</i>, q.v.), in the right light. He will think that it is his ego, his personality, that experiences suffering, his personality that performs good and evil actions and will be reborn according to these actions, his personality that will enter into Nibbāna, his personality that walks on the Eightfold Path. Thus it is said in Vis.M. XVI:<br><br>\"Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;<br><br>The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;<br><br>Nibbāna is, but not the man that enters it;<br><br>The path is, but no traveler on it is seen.\"<br><br>\"Whosoever is not clear with regard to the conditionally arisen phenomena, and does not comprehend that all the actions are conditioned through ignorance, etc., he thinks that it is an ego that understands or does not understand, that acts or causes to act, that comes to existence at rebirth.... that has the sense-impression, that feels, desires, becomes attached, continues and at rebirth again enters a new existence\" (Vis.M. XVII, 117).<br><br>While in the case of the first two characteristics it is stated that all formations (<i>sabbe saṅkhārā</i>) are impermanent and subject to suffering, the corresponding text for the third characteristic states that \"all things are not-self\" (<i>sabbe dhammā anattā</i>; M. 35, Dhp. 279). This is for emphasizing that the false view of an abiding self or substance is neither applicable to any 'formation' or conditioned phenomenon, nor to Nibbāna, the Unconditioned Element (<i>asaṅkhatā dhātu</i>).<br><br>The <i>Anattā-lakkhaṇa Sutta</i>, the 'Discourse on the Characteristic of Not-self', was the second discourse after Enlightenment, preached by the Buddha to his first five disciples, who after hearing it attained  to perfect Holiness (<i>Arahatta</i>).<br><br>The contemplation of not-self (<i>anattānupassanā</i>) leads to the emptiness liberation (<i>suññatā-vimokkha</i>, s. <i>vimokkha</i>). Herein the faculty of wisdom (<i>paññindriya</i>) is outstanding, and one who attains in that way the path of Stream-entry is called a <i>Dhamma-</i>devotee (<i>dhammānusāri</i>; s. <i>ariya-puggala</i>); at the next two stages of sainthood he becomes a vision-attainer (<i>diṭṭhippatta</i>); and at the highest stage, i.e. Holiness, he is called 'liberated by wisdom' (<i>paññā-vimutta</i>).<br><br>For further details, see <i>paramattha-sacca</i>, <i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i>, <i>khandha</i>, <i>ti-lakkhaṇa</i>, <i>nāma-rūpa</i>, <i>paṭisandhi</i>.<br><br>Literature: Anattā-lakkhaṇa Sutta, Vinaya I, 13-14; S. XXII, 59; tr. in Three Cardinal Discourses of the Buddha (WHEEL 17). - Another important text on Anattā is the Discourse on the Snake Simile (Alagaddūpama Sutta, M. 22; tr. in WHEEL 48/49).

        "'impermanent' (or, as abstract noun, <i>aniccatā</i>, 'impermanence') is the first of the three characteristics of existence (<i>tilakkhaṇa</i>, q.v.). It is from the fact of impermanence that, in most texts, the other two characteristics, suffering (<i>dukkha</i>) and not-self (<i>anattā</i>), are derived (S. XXII, 15; Ud. IV, I)<br><br>\"Impermanence of things is the rising, passing and changing of things, or the disappearance of things that have become or arisen. The meaning is that these things never persist in the same way, but that they are vanishing dissolving from moment to moment\" (Vis.M. VII, 3).<br><br>Impermanence is a basic feature of all conditioned phenomena, be they material or mental, coarse or subtle, one's own or external: “All formations are impermanent” (<i>sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā</i>; M 35, Dhp. 277). That the totality of existence is impermanent is also often stated in terms of the five aggregates (<i>khandha</i>, q.v.), the twelve personal and external sense bases (<i>āyatana</i> q.v.), etc. Only Nibbāna (q.v.), which is unconditioned and not a formation (<i>asaṅkhata</i>), is permanent (<i>nicca</i>, <i>dhuva</i>).<br><br>The insight leading to the first stage of deliverance, Stream-entry (<i>Sotāpatti</i>; s. <i>ariya-puggala</i>), is often expressed in terms of impermanence: \"Whatever is subject to origination, is subject to cessation\" (s. <i>Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</i>, S. XLVI, 11). In his last exhortation, before his <i>Parinibbāna</i>, the Buddha reminded his monks of the impermanence of existence as a spur to earnest effort: \"Behold now, Bhikkhus, I exhort you: Formations are bound to vanish. Strive earnestly!\" (<i>vayadhammā saṅkhārā</i>, <i>appamādena sampādetha</i>; D. 16).<br><br>Without the deep insight into the impermanence and insubstantiality of all phenomena of existence there is no attainment of deliverance. Hence comprehension of impermanence gained by direct meditative experience heads two lists of insight knowledge: (a) contemplation of impermanence (<i>aniccānupassanā</i>) is the first of the 18 chief kinds of insight (q.v.); (b) the contemplation of arising and vanishing (<i>udayabbayānupassanā-ñāṇa</i>) is the first of 9 kinds of knowledge which lead to the 'purification by knowledge and vision of the path-progress' (s. <i>visuddhi</i>, VI). - Contemplation of impermanence leads to the conditionless deliverance (<i>animitta -vimokkha</i>; s. <i>vimokkha</i>). As herein the faculty of confidence (<i>saddhindriya</i>) is outstanding, he who attains in that way the path of Stream-entry is called a faith-devotee (<i>saddhānusārī</i>; s. <i>ariya-puggala</i>) and at the seven higher stages he is called faith-liberated (<i>saddhā-vimutta</i>), - See also <i>anicca-saññā</i>.<br><br>See The Three Basic Facts of Existence I: Impermanence (WHEEL 186/187)"

This Community of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of reverence with raised hands, the unsurpassed field for doing meritorious deeds.'<br><br>(4) \"The noble disciple further recollects his own morality (<i>sīla</i>) which is unbroken, without any breach, undefiled, untarnished, conducive to liberation, praised by the wise, not dependent (on craving or opinions), leading to concentration.<br><br>(5) \"The noble disciple further recollects his own liberality (<i>cāga</i>) thus: 'Blessed truly am I, highly blessed am I who, amongst beings defiled with the filth of stinginess, live with heart free from stinginess, liberal, open-handed, rejoicing in giving, ready to give anything asked for, glad to give and share with others.'<br><br>(6) \"The noble disciple further recollects the heavenly beings (<i>devatā</i>): 'There are the heavenly beings of the retinue of the Four Great Kings, the heavenly beings of the World of the Thirty-Three, the <i>Yāmadevas</i>... and there are heavenly beings besides (s. <i>deva</i>).

In the joyous one rapture arises. With heart enraptured, his whole being becomes stilled. Stilled within his being, he feels happiness; and the mind of the happy one becomes firm.

It is the delusion tricking beings by making life appear to them as permanent, happy, substantial and beautiful and preventing them from seeing that everything in reality is impermanent, liable to suffering, void of 'I' and 'mine', and basically impure (s. <i>vipallāsa</i>). Ignorance is defined as 'not knowing the four truths, namely, suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the way to its cessation' (S. XII, 4).<br><br>As ignorance is the foundation of all life-affirming actions, of all evil and suffering, therefore it stands first in the formula of Dependent Origination (<i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i>, q.v.). But for that reason, says Vis.M. (XVII, 36f) ignorance should not be regarded as \"the causeless root-cause of the world... It is not causeless. For a cause of it is stated thus 'With the arising of cankers (<i>āsava</i>, q.v.) there is the arising of ignorance' (M. 9). But there is a figurative way in which it can be treated as a root-cause; namely, when it is made to serve as a starting point in an exposition of the Round of Existence... As it is said: 'No first beginning of ignorance can be perceived, Bhikkhus, before which ignorance was not, and after which it came to be. But it can be perceived that ignorance has its specific condition (<i>idappaccaya</i>)\" (A. X, 61). The same statement is made (A. X, 62) about the craving for existence (<i>bhava-taṇhā</i>; s. <i>taṇhā</i>). The latter and ignorance are called \"the outstanding causes of kamma that lead to unhappy and happy destinies\" (Vis.M. XVII, 38).<br><br>As ignorance still exists - though in a very refined way until the attainment of Arahatship or Holiness, it is counted as the last of the 10 fetters (<i>saṃyojana</i>, q.v.) which bind beings to the cycle of rebirths. As the first two roots of evil, greed and hate (s. <i>mūla</i>), are on their part rooted in ignorance, consequently all unwholesome states of mind are inseparably bound up with it. Ignorance (or delusion) is the most obstinate of the three roots of evil.<br><br>Ignorance is one of the cankers (<i>āsava</i>, q.v.) and proclivities (<i>anusaya</i>, q.v.). It is often called a hindrance (<i>nīvaraṇa</i>; e.g. in S.XV, 3; A.X, 61) but does not appear together with the usual list of five hindrances."

It is also an object of <i>kasiṇa</i> (q.v.) meditation. It is defined as follows: \"The space element has the characteristic of delimiting matter. Its function is to indicate the boundaries of matter. It is manifested as the confines of matter; or its manifestation consists in being untouched (by the 4 great elements), and in holes and apertures. Its proximate cause is the matter delimited. It is on account of the space element that one can say of material things delimited that 'this is above. below, around that' \" (Vis.M. XIV, 63).<br><br>2.

It is the object of the first immaterial absorption (s. <i>jhāna</i>), the sphere of boundless space (<i>ākāsānañcāyatana</i>). According to <i>Abhidhamma</i> philosophy, endless space has no objective reality (being purely conceptual), which is indicated by the fact that it is not included in the triad of the wholesome (<i>kusala-tika</i>), which comprises the entire reality. Later Buddhist schools have regarded it as one of several unconditioned or uncreated states (<i>asaṅkhatadhamma</i>) - a view that is rejected in Kath. (s.

II as \"that phenomenon which is built up of the four physical elements and appears as color, etc.\" What is' seen by-visual perception, i.e. by eye-consciousness (<i>cakkhu-viññāṇa</i>) are colors and differences of light, but not three dimensional bodily things.<br><br>'Mind-object-base' (<i>dhammāyatana</i>) is identical with 'mind-object-element' (<i>dhamma-dhātu</i>; s. <i>dhātu</i> II) and <i>dhammārammaṇa</i> (s. <i>ārammaṇa</i>). It may be physical or mental, past, present or future, real or imaginary.<br><br>The 5 physical sense-organs are also called faculties (<i>indriya</i>, q.v.), and of these faculties it is said in M. 43: \"Each of the five faculties owns a different sphere, and none of them partakes of the sphere of another one;... they have mind as their support... are conditioned by vitality,... but vitality again is conditioned by heat, heat again by vitality, just as the light and flame of a burning lamp are mutually conditioned.\"<br><br>The 12 bases are fully discussed in Vis.M. XV. In Yam III (s Guide, p 98f) the 12 terms are subjected to a logical investigation The six personal bases form the 5th link of dependent origination (<i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i> 5, q.v.)."

        "(Sanskrit: karma): 'action', correctly speaking denotes the wholesome and unwholesome volitions (<i>kusala</i>- and <i>akusala</i>-<i>cetanā</i>) and their concomitant mental factors, causing rebirth and shaping the destiny of beings. These kammical volitions (<i>kamma cetanā</i>) become manifest as wholesome or unwholesome actions by body (<i>kāya-kamma</i>), speech (<i>vacī-kamma</i>) and mind (<i>mano-kamma</i>). Thus the Buddhist term 'kamma' by no means signifies the result of actions, and quite certainly not the fate of man, or perhaps even of whole nations (the so-called wholesale or mass-kamma), misconceptions which, through the influence of theosophy, have become widely spread in the West.<br><br>\"Volition (<i>cetanā</i>), o monks, is what I call action (<i>cetanāhaṃ bhikkhave kammaṃ vadāmi</i>), for through volition one performs the action by body, speech or mind.. There is kamma (action), o monks, that ripens in hell.... Kamma that ripens in the animal world.. Kamma that ripens in the world of men.... Kamma that ripens in the heavenly world.... Threefold, however, is the fruit of kamma: ripening during the life-time (<i>diṭṭha-dhamma-vedanīya kamma</i>), ripening in the next birth (<i>upapajja-vedanīya kamma</i>), ripening in later births (<i>aparāpariya-vedanīya kamma</i>)....\" (A.VI, 63).<br><br>The 3 conditions or roots (<i>mūla</i>, q.v.) of unwholesome kamma (actions) are greed, hatred, delusion (<i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i>, <i>moha</i>); those of wholesome kamma are: unselfishness (<i>alobha</i>), hatelessness (<i>adosa</i> = <i>mettā</i>, good-will), undeludedness (<i>amoha</i> = <i>paññā</i>, knowledge).<br><br>\"Greed, o monks, is a condition for the arising of kamma; hatred is a condition for the arising of kamma; delusion is a condition for the arising of kamma....\" (A. III, 109).<br><br>\"The unwholesome actions are of 3 kinds, conditioned by greed, or hate, or delusion.<br><br>\"Killing... stealing... unlawful sexual intercourse... lying... slandering... rude speech... foolish babble, if practised, carried on, and frequently cultivated, leads to rebirth in hell, or amongst the animals, or amongst the ghosts\" (A. III, 40). \"He who kills and is cruel goes either to hell or, if reborn as man, will be short-lived. He who torments others will be afflicted with disease. The angry one will look ugly, the envious one will be without influence, the stingy one will be poor, the stubborn one will be of low descent, the indolent one will be without knowledge. In the contrary case, man will be reborn in heaven or reborn as man, he will be long-lived, possessed of beauty, influence, noble descent and knowledge\" (cf. M. 135).<br><br>For the above 10-fold wholesome and unwholesome course of action, see <i>kamma-patha</i>. For the 5 heinous crimes with immediate result, s. <i>ānantarika-kamma</i>.<br><br>\"Owners of their kamma are the beings, heirs of their kamma, their kamma is their womb from which they are born, their kamma is their friend, their refuge. Whatever kamma they perform, good or bad, thereof they will be the heirs\" (M. 135).<br><br>With regard to the time of the taking place of the kamma-result (<i>vipāka</i>), one distinguishes, as mentioned above, 3 kinds of kamma:<br><br>1. kamma ripening during the life-time (<i>diṭṭha-dhamma-vedanīya kamma</i>);<br><br>2. kamma ripening in the next birth (<i>upapajja-vedanīya kamma</i>);<br><br>3. kamma ripening in later births (<i>aparāpariya-vedanīya kamma</i>).<br><br>The first two kinds of kamma may be without kamma-result (<i>vipāka</i>), if the circumstances required for the taking place of the kamma-result are missing, or if, through the preponderance of counteractive kamma and their being too weak, they are unable to produce any result. In this case they are called <i>ahosi-kamma</i>, lit. 'kamma that has been', in other words, ineffectual kamma.<br><br>The third type of kamma, however, which bears fruit in later lives, will, whenever and wherever there is an opportunity, be productive of kamma-result. Before its result has ripened, it will never become ineffective as long as the life-process is kept going by craving and ignorance.<br><br>According to the Com., e.g. Vis.M. XIX, the 1st of the 7 kammical impulsive-moments (<i>kamma-javana</i>; s. <i>javana</i>) is considered as 'kamma ripening during the life-time', the 7th moment as 'kamma ripening in the next birth', the remaining 5 moments as 'kamma ripening in later births'.<br><br>With regard to their functions one distinguishes:<br><br>1. regenerative (or productive) kamma (<i>janaka-kamma</i>),<br><br>2. supportive (or consolidating) kamma (<i>upatthambhaka kamma</i>),<br><br>3. counteractive (suppressive or frustrating) kamma (<i>upapīḷaka kamma</i>),<br><br>4. destructive (or supplanting) kamma (<i>upaghātaka-</i> or <i>upacchedaka kamma</i>).<br><br>(1) produces the 5 groups of existence (corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) at rebirth as well as during life-continuity.<br><br>(2) does not produce kamma-results but is only able to maintain the already produced kamma-results.<br><br>(3) counteracts or suppresses the kamma-results.<br><br>(4) destroys the influence of a weaker kamma and effects only its own result.<br><br>With regard to the priority of their result one distinguishes:<br><br>1. weighty kamma (<i>garuka kamma</i>),<br><br>2. habitual kamma (<i>āciṇṇaka-</i> or <i>bahula-kamma</i>),<br><br>3. death-proximate kamma (<i>maraṇāsanna kamma</i>),<br><br>4. stored-up kamma (<i>kaṭattākamma</i>).<br><br>(1, 2) The weighty (<i>garuka</i>) and the habitual (<i>bahula</i>) wholesome or unwholesome kamma are ripening earlier than the light and rarely performed kamma. (3) The death-proximate (<i>maraṇāsanna</i>) kamma - i.e. the wholesome or unwholesome volition present immediately before death, which often may be the reflex of some previously performed good or evil action (<i>kamma</i>), or of a sign of it (<i>kamma</i>-<i>nimitta</i>), or of a sign of the future existence (<i>gati-nimitta</i>) - produces rebirth. (4) In the absence of any of these three actions at the moment before death, the stored-up (<i>katattā</i>) kamma will produce rebirth.<br><br>A real, and in the ultimate sense true, understanding of Buddhist kamma doctrine is possible only through a deep insight into the impersonality (s. <i>anattā</i>) and conditionality (s. <i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i>, <i>paccaya</i>) of all phenomena of existence. \"Everywhere, in all the forms of existence... such a one is beholding merely mental and physical phenomena kept going by their being bound up through causes and effects.<br><br>\"No doer does he see behind the deeds, no recipient apart from the kamma-fruit. And with full insight he clearly understands that the wise ones are using merely conventional terms when, with regard to the taking place of any action, they speak of a doer, or when they speak of a receiver of the kamma-results at their arising. Therefore the ancient masters have said:<br><br>'No doer of the deeds is found,<br><br>No one who ever reaps their fruits;<br><br>Empty phenomena roll on:<br><br>This view alone is right and true.<br><br> <br><br>'And whilst the deeds and their results<br><br>Roll on, based on conditions all,<br><br>There no beginning can be seen,<br><br>Just as it is with seed and tree.' \" (Vis.M.

Now, just as one repeats the exercise in words, one should do it also in mind. The repeating in mind forms the condition for the penetration of the characteristic marks.... He who thus has examined the parts of the body as to colour, shape, region, locality and limits, and considers them one by one, and not too hurriedly, as something loathsome, to such a one, while contemplating the body, all these things at the same time are appearing distinctly clear. But also when keeping one's attention fixed outwardly (i.e. to the bodies of other beings), and when all the parts appear distinctly, then all men and animals moving about lose the appearance of living beings and appear like heaps of many different things. And it looks as if those foods and drinks, being swallowed by them, were being inserted into this heap of things. Now, while again and again one is conceiving the idea 'Disgusting! Disgusting!' - omitting in due course several parts - gradually the attainment - concentration (<i>appanā-samādhi</i>, i.e. the concentration of the <i>jhāna</i>) will be reached. In this connection, the appearing of forms... is called the acquired image (<i>uggaha-nimitta</i>), the arising of loathsomeness, however, the counter-image (<i>paṭibhāga-nimitta</i>).\""

        "'kammically wholesome' or 'profitable', salutary, morally good, (skillful) Connotations of the term, according to Com. (<i>Aṭṭhasālinī</i>), are: of good health, blameless, productive of favourable kamma-result, skillful. It should be noted that Com. excludes the meaning 'skillful', when the term is applied to states of consciousness.<br><br>It is defined in M. 9 as the 10 wholesome courses of action (s. <i>kammapatha</i>). In psychological terms, 'kammically wholesome' are all those kammical volitions (<i>kamma-cetanā</i>) and the consciousness and mental factors associated therewith, which are accompanied by 2 or 3 wholesome roots (s. <i>mūla</i>), i.e. by greedlessness (<i>alobha</i>) and hatelessness (<i>adosa</i>), and in some cases also by non-delusion (<i>amoha</i>: wisdom, understanding). Such states of consciousness are regarded as 'kammically wholesome' as they are causes of favourable kamma results and contain the seeds of a happy destiny or rebirth. From this explanation, two facts should be noted: (1) it is volition that makes a state of consciousness, or an act, 'good' or 'bad'; (2) the moral criterion in Buddhism is the presence or absence of the 3 wholesome or moral roots (s. <i>mūla</i>).<br><br>The above explanations refer to mundane (<i>lokiya</i>, q.v.) wholesome consciousness. Supermundane wholesome (<i>lokuttara-kusala</i>) states, i.e. the four paths of sanctity (s. <i>ariyapuggala</i>), have as results only the corresponding four fruitions; they do not constitute kamma, nor do they lead to rebirth, and this applies also to the good actions of an Arahat (Tab. I, 73-80) and his meditative states (Tab. 1, 81-89), which are all kammically inoperative (functional; s. <i>kiriya</i>).<br><br><i>Kusala</i> belongs to a threefold division of all consciousness, as found in the <i>Abhidhamma</i> (Dhs.), into wholesome (<i>kusala</i>), unwholesome (<i>akusala</i>) and kammically neutral (<i>avyākata</i>), which is the first of the triads (<i>tika</i>) in the <i>Abhidhamma</i> schedule (<i>mātikā</i>); s.

        "the 5 'groups (of existence)' or 'groups of clinging' (<i>upādānakkhandha</i>); alternative renderings: aggregates, categories of clinging's objects. These are the 5 aspects in which the Buddha has summed up all the physical and mental phenomena of existence, and which appear to the ignorant man as his ego, or personality, to wit:<br><br>(1) the corporeality group (<i>rūpa-kkhandha</i>),<br><br>(2) the feeling group (<i>vedanā-kkhandha</i>),<br><br>(3) the perception group (<i>saññā-kkhandha</i>),<br><br>(4) the mental-formation group (<i>saṅkhāra-kkhandha</i>),<br><br>(5) the consciousness-group (<i>viññāṇa-kkhandha</i>).<br><br>\"Whatever there exists of corporeal things, whether past, present or future, one's own or external, gross or subtle, lofty or low, far or near, all that belongs to the corporeality group. Whatever there exists of feeling... of perception... of mental formations... of consciousness... all that belongs to the consciousness-group\" (S. XXII, 48). - Another division is that into the 2 groups: mind (2-5) and corporeality (1) (<i>nāma-rūpa</i>), whilst in <i>Dhammasaṅganī</i>, the first book of the <i>Abhidhamma</i>, all the phenomena are treated by way of 3 groups: consciousness (5), mental factors (2-4), corporeality (1), in <i>Pāḷi</i> <i>citta</i>, <i>cetasika</i>, <i>rūpa</i>. Cf. Guide I.<br><br>What is called individual existence is in reality nothing but a mere process of those mental and physical phenomena, a process that since time immemorial has been going on, and that also after death will still continue for unthinkably long periods of time. These 5 groups, however, neither singly nor collectively constitute any self-dependent real ego-entity, or personality (<i>attā</i>), nor is there to be found any such entity apart from them. Hence the belief in such an ego-entity or personality, as real in the ultimate sense, proves a mere illusion.<br><br>\"When all constituent parts are there,<br><br>The designation 'cart' is used;<br><br>Just so, where the five groups exist,<br><br>Of 'living being' do we speak.\" (S. V. 10).<br><br>The fact ought to be emphasized here that these 5 groups, correctly speaking, merely form an abstract classification by the Buddha, but that they as such, i.e. as just these 5 complete groups, have no real existence, since only single representatives of these groups, mostly variable, can arise with any state of consciousness. For example, with one and the same unit of consciousness only one single kind of feeling, say joy or sorrow, can be associated and never more than one. Similarly, two different perceptions cannot arise at the same moment. Also, of the various kinds of sense-cognition or consciousness, only one can be present at a time, for example, seeing, hearing or inner consciousness, etc. Of the 50 mental formations, however, a smaller or larger number are always associated with every state of consciousness, as we shall see later on.<br><br>Some writers on Buddhism who have not understood that the five <i>khandha</i> are just classificatory groupings, have conceived them as compact entities ('heaps', 'bundles'), while actually, as stated above, the groups never exist as such, i.e. they never occur in a simultaneous totality of all their constituents. Also those single constituents of a group which are present in any given body- and -mind process, are of an evanescent nature, and so also their varying combinations. Feeling, perception and mental formations are only different aspects and functions of a single unit of consciousness. They are to consciousness what redness, softness, sweetness, etc. are to an apple and have as little separate existence as those qualities.<br><br>In S. XXII, 56, there is the following short definition of these 5 groups:<br><br>\"What, o monks, is the corporeality-group? The 4 primary elements (<i>Mahā-bhūta</i> or <i>dhātu</i>) and corporeality depending thereon, this is called the corporeality-group.<br><br>\"What, o monks, is the feeling-group? There are 6 classes of feeling: due to visual impression, to sound impression, to odour impression, to taste impression, to bodily impression, and to mind impression....<br><br>\"What, o monks, is the perception-group? There are 6 classes of perception: perception of visual objects, of sounds, of odours, of tastes, of bodily impressions, and of mental impressions....<br><br>\"What, o monks, is the group of mental formations? There are 6 classes of volitional states (<i>cetanā</i>): with regard to visual objects, to sounds, to odours, to tastes, to bodily impressions and to mind objects....<br><br>\"What, o monks, is the consciousness-group? There are 6 classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness.\"<br><br>About the inseparability of the groups it is said:<br><br>''Whatever, o brother, there exists of feeling, of perception and of mental formations, these things are associated, not dissociated, and it is impossible to separate one from the other and show their difference. For whatever one feels, one perceives; and whatever one perceives, of this one is conscious\" (M. 43).<br><br>Further: \"Impossible is it for anyone to explain the passing out of one existence and the entering into a new existence, or the growth, increase and development of consciousness independent of corporeality, feeling, perception and mental formations\" (S. XII, 53)<br><br>For the inseparability and mutual conditionality of the 4 mental groups s. <i>paccaya</i> (6, 7).<br><br>Regarding the impersonality (<i>anattā</i>) and emptiness (<i>suññatā</i>) of the 5 groups, it is said in S. XXII, 49:<br><br>\"Whatever there is of corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness, whether past, present or future, one's own or external, gross or subtle, lofty or low, far or near, this one should understand according to reality and true wisdom: 'This does not belong to me, this am I not, this is not my Ego.' \"<br><br>Further in S. XXII, 95: \"Suppose that a man who is not blind were to behold the many bubbles on the Ganges as they are driving along; and he should watch them and carefully examine them. After carefully examining them, however, they will appear to him empty, unreal and unsubstantial. In exactly the same way does the monk behold all the corporeal phenomena... feelings... perceptions... mental formations... states of consciousness, whether they be of the past, present or future... far or near. And he watches them and examines them carefully; and after carefully examining them, they appear to him empty, unreal and unsubstantial.\"<br><br>The 5 groups are compared, respectively, to a lump of froth, a bubble, a mirage, a coreless plantain stem, and a conjuring trick (S. XXII, 95).<br><br>See the <i>Khandha</i> <i>Saṃyutta</i> (S. XXII); Vis.M. XIV.<br><br> <br><br>SUMMARY OF THE 5 GROUPS<br><br> <br><br>I.

One such moment is said in the commentaries to be of inconceivably short duration and to last not longer than the billionth part of the time occupied by a flash of lightning. However that may be, we ourselves know from experience that it is possible within one single second to dream of innumerable things and events. In A. I, 10 it is said: \"Nothing, o monks, do I know that changes so rapidly as consciousness. Scarcely anything may be found that could be compared with this so rapidly changing consciousness.\" (App. <i>khaṇa</i>)."

        "'absorption' (meditation) refers chiefly to the four meditative absorptions of the fine-material sphere (<i>rūpa-jjhāna</i> or <i>rūpāvacara</i>-j<i>jhāna</i>; s. <i>avacara</i>). They are achieved through the attainment of full (or attainment -, or ecstatic) concentration (<i>appanā</i>, s. <i>samādhi</i>), during which there is a complete, though temporary, suspension of fivefold sense-activity and of the 5 hindrances (s. <i>nīvaraṇa</i>). The state of consciousness, however, is one of full alertness and lucidity. This high degree of concentration is generally developed by the practice of one of the 40 subjects of tranquillity meditation (<i>samatha-kammaṭṭhāna</i>; s. <i>bhāvanā</i>). Often also the 4 immaterial spheres (<i>arūpāyatana</i>) are called absorptions of the immaterial sphere (<i>arūpa-jjhāna</i> or <i>arūpāvacara-jjhāna</i>). The stereotype text, often met with in the <i>Suttas </i>, runs as follows:<br><br>(1) \"Detached from sensual objects, o monks, detached from unwholesome consciousness, attached with thought-conception (<i>vitakka</i>) and discursive thinking (<i>vicāra</i>), born of detachment (<i>viveka ja</i>) and filled with rapture (<i>pīti</i>) and joy (<i>sukha</i>) he enters the first absorption.<br><br>(2) \"After the subsiding of thought-conception and discursive thinking, and by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he enters into a state free from thought-conception and discursive thinking, the second absorption, which is born of concentration (<i>samādhi</i>), and filled with rapture (<i>pīti</i>) and joy (<i>sukha</i>).<br><br>(3) \"After the fading away of rapture he dwells in equanimity, mindful, clearly conscious; and he experiences in his person that feeling of which the Noble Ones say, 'Happy lives the man of equanimity and attentive mind'; thus he enters the 3rd absorption.<br><br>(4) \"After having given up pleasure and pain, and through the disappearance of previous joy and grief, he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain, into the 4th absorption, which is purified by equanimity (<i>upekkhā</i>) and mindfulness.<br><br>(5) \"Through the total overcoming of the perceptions of matter, however, and through the vanishing of sense-reactions and the non-attention to the perceptions of variety, with the idea, 'Boundless is space', he reaches the sphere of boundless space (<i>ākāsānañcāyatana</i>) and abides therein.<br><br>[\"By 'perceptions of matter' (<i>rūpa-saññā</i>) are meant the absorptions of the fine-material sphere, as well as those objects themselves... \" (Vis.M. X, 1).<br><br>\"By 'perceptions of sense-reactions' (<i>paṭigha-saññā</i>) are meant those perceptions that have arisen due to the impact of sense-organs (eye, etc.) and the sense-objects (visible objects, etc.). They are a name for the perception of visible objects, as it is said (<i>Jhāna Vibh.</i> ): 'What are here the perceptions of sense-reactions? They are the perceptions of visible objects, sounds, etc.' - Surely, they do no longer exist even for one who has entered the 1st absorption, etc., for at such a time the five-sense consciousness is no longer functioning. Nevertheless, this is to be understood as having been said in praise of this immaterial absorption, in order to incite the striving for it\" (Vis.M. X, 16).<br><br>\"Perceptions of variety (<i>ñāṇatta-saññā</i>) are the perceptions that arise in various fields, or the various perceptions\" (ib.). Hereby, according to Vis.M. X, 20, are meant the multiform perceptions outside the absorptions.]<br><br>(6) \"Through the total overcoming of the sphere of boundless space, and with the idea 'Boundless is consciousness', he reaches the sphere of boundless consciousness (<i>viññāṇañcāyatana</i>) and abides therein.<br><br>(7) \"Through the total overcoming of the sphere of boundless consciousness, and with the idea 'Nothing is there', he reaches the sphere of nothingness (<i>ākiñcaññāyatana</i>) and abides therein.<br><br>(8) \"Through the total overcoming of the sphere of nothingness he reaches the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception (<i>nevasaññā-n’asaññāyatana</i>) and abides therein.\"<br><br>\"Thus the 1st absorption is free from 5 things (i.e. the hindrances, <i>nīvaraṇa</i>, q.v.), and 5 things are present (i.e. the factors of absorption; <i>jhānaṅga</i>). Whenever the monk enters the 1st absorption, there have vanished sensuous desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and scruples, doubts; and there are present: thought-conception (<i>vitakka</i>), discursive thinking (<i>vicāra</i>) rapture (<i>pīti</i>), joy (<i>sukha</i>), and concentration (<i>samādhi</i>). In the 2nd absorption there are present: rapture, joy and concentration; in the 3rd: joy and concentration; in the 4th: equanimity (<i>upekkhā</i>) and concentration\" (Vis.M. IV).<br><br>The 4 absorptions of the immaterial sphere (s. above 5-8) still belong, properly speaking, to the 4th absorption as they possess the same two constituents. The 4th fine-material absorption is also the base or starting point (<i>pādaka-jhāna</i>, q.v.) for the attaining of the higher spiritual powers (<i>abhiññā</i>, q.v.).<br><br>In the <i>Abhidhamma</i>, generally a fivefold instead of a fourfold division of the fine-material absorptions is used: the 2nd absorption has still the constituent 'discursive thinking' (but without thought-conception), while the 3rd, 4th and 5th correspond to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th, respectively, of the fourfold division (s. Tab. I, 9- 13). This fivefold division is based on <i>Sutta</i> texts like A.

This personality-belief (<i>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</i>), or ego-illusion (<i>atta-diṭṭhi</i>), is of 2 kinds: eternity-belief and annihilation-belief.<br><br>Eternity-belief (<i>sassata-diṭṭhi</i>) is the belief in the existence of a persisting ego-entity, soul or personality, existing independently of those physical and mental processes that constitute life and continuing even after death.<br><br>Annihilation-belief (<i>uccheda-diṭṭhi</i>), on the other hand, is the belief in the existence of an ego-entity or personality as being more or less identical with those physical and mental processes, and which therefore, at the dissolution at death, will come to be annihilated. - For the 20 kinds of personality-belief, see <i>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</i>.<br><br>Now, the Buddha neither teaches a personality which will continue after death, nor does he teach a personality which will be annihilated at death, but he shows us that 'personality', 'ego', 'individual', 'man', etc., are nothing but mere conventional designations (<i>vohāra-vacana</i>) and that in the ultimate sense (s. <i>paramattha-sacca</i>) there is only this self-consuming process of physical and mental phenomena which continually arise and again disappear immediately. - For further details, s. <i>anattā</i>, <i>khandha</i>, <i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i>.<br><br>\"The Perfect One is free from any theory (<i>diṭṭhigata</i>), for the Perfect One has seen what corporeality is, and how it arises and passes away.

The simile of the butcher in M. 10 (\"Just, o monks, as a skilled butcher or butcher's apprentice, after having slaughtered a cow and divided it into separate portions, should sit down at the junction of four highroads; just so does the disciple contemplate this body with regard to the elements\") is thus explained in Vis.M. XI.: \"To the butcher, who rears the cow, brings it to the slaughter-house, ties it, puts it there, slaughters it, or looks at the slaughtered and dead cow, the idea 'cow' does not disappear as long as he has not yet cut the body open and taken it to pieces. As soon, however, as he sits down, after having cut it open and taken it to pieces, the idea 'cow' disappears to him, and the idea 'meat' arises. And he does not think: 'A cow do I sell, or 'A cow do they buy.' Just so, when the monk formerly was still an ignorant worldling, layman or a homeless one, the ideas 'living being' or 'man' or 'individual' had not yet disappeared as long as he had not taken this body, whatever position or direction it had, to pieces and analysed it piece by piece.

May you train yourself therein all your life.\"<br><br>Since the moral quality of any action depends entirely upon the accompanying intention and volition, this is also the case with these ascetic practices, as is expressly stated in Vis.M. Thus the mere external performance is not the real exercise, as it is said (Pug. 275-84): \"Some one might be going for alms; etc. out of stupidity and foolishness - or with evil intention and filled with desires - or out of insanity and mental derangement - or because such practice had been praised by the Noble Ones....\" These exercises are, however properly observed \"if they are taken up only for the sake of frugality, of contentedness, of purity, etc.\"(App.)<br><br>On dhutaṅga practice in modern Thailand, see With Robes and Bowl, by Bhikkhu Khantipālo (WHEEL 82/83)."

On their mutual dependence, see also <i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i> (3).<br><br>With regard to the impersonality and dependent nature of mind and corporeality it is said:<br><br>\"Sound is not a thing that dwells inside the conch-shell and comes out from time to time, but due to both, the conch-shell and the man that blows it, sound comes to arise: Just so, due to the presence of vitality, heat and consciousness, this body may execute the acts of going, standing, sitting and lying down, and the 5 sense-organs and the mind may perform their various functions\" (D. 23).<br><br>\"Just as a wooden puppet though unsubstantial, lifeless and inactive may by means of pulling strings be made to move about, stand up, and appear full of life and activity; just so are mind and body, as such, something empty, lifeless and inactive; but by means of their mutual working together, this mental and bodily combination may move about, stand up, and appear full of life and activity.\""

        "(Sanskrit nirvāna): lit. 'extinction' (<i>nir</i> + <i>√vā</i>, to cease blowing, to become extinguished); according to the commentaries, 'freedom from desire' (<i>nir </i>+ <i>vana</i>). Nibbāna constitutes the highest and ultimate goal of all Buddhist aspirations, i.e. absolute extinction of that life-affirming will manifested as greed, hate and delusion, and convulsively clinging to existence; and therewith also the ultimate and absolute deliverance from all future rebirth, old age, disease and death, from all suffering and misery. Cf. <i>Parinibbāna</i>.<br><br>\"Extinction of greed, extinction of hate, extinction of delusion: this is called Nibbāna\" (S. XXXVIII. 1).<br><br>The 2 aspects of <i>Nibbāna</i> are:<br><br>(1) The full extinction of defilements (<i>kilesa-parinibbāna</i>), also called <i>sa-upādi-sesa-nibbāna  </i>(s. It. 41), i.e. 'Nibbāna with the groups of existence still remaining' (s. <i>upādi</i>). This takes place at the attainment of Arahatship, or perfect holiness (s. <i>ariya-puggala</i>).<br><br>(2) The full extinction of the groups of existence (<i>khandha</i>-<i>parinibbāna</i>), also called <i>an-upādi-sesa-nibbāna</i> (s. It. 41, A. IV, 118), i.e. 'Nibbāna without the groups remaining', in other words, the coming to rest, or rather the 'no-more-continuing' of this physico-mental process of existence. This takes place at the death of the Arahat. - (App.: Nibbāna).<br><br>Sometimes both aspects take place at one and the same moment, i.e. at the death of the Arahat; s. <i>sama-sīsī</i>.<br><br>\"This, o monks, truly is the peace, this is the highest, namely the end of all formations, the forsaking of every substratum of rebirth, the fading away of craving, detachment, extinction, Nibbāna\" (A. III, 32).<br><br>\"Enraptured with lust (<i>rāga</i>), enraged with anger (<i>dosa</i>), blinded by delusion (<i>moha</i>), overwhelmed, with mind ensnared, man aims at his own ruin, at the ruin of others, at the ruin of both, and he experiences mental pain and grief. But if lust, anger and delusion are given up, man aims neither at his own ruin, nor at the ruin of others, nor at the ruin of both, and he experiences no mental pain and grief. Thus is Nibbāna visible in this life, immediate, inviting, attractive, and comprehensible to the wise\" (A. III, 55).<br><br>\"Just as a rock of one solid mass remains unshaken by the wind, even so neither visible forms, nor sounds, nor odours, nor tastes, nor bodily impressions, neither the desired nor the undesired, can cause such a one to waver. Steadfast is his mind, gained is deliverance\" (A, VI, 55).<br><br>\"Verily, there is an Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed. If there were not this Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed, escape from the world of the born, the originated, the created, the formed, would not be possible\" (Ud. VIII, 3).<br><br>One cannot too often and too emphatically stress the fact that not only for the actual realization of the goal of Nibbāna, but also for a theoretical understanding of it, it is an indispensable preliminary condition to grasp fully the truth of <i>anattā</i>(q.v.), the egolessness and insubstantiality of all forms of existence. Without such an understanding, one will necessarily misconceive Nibbāna - according to one's either materialistic or metaphysical leanings - either as annihilation of an ego, or as an eternal state of existence into which an ego or self enters or with which it merges. Hence it is said:<br><br>\"Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;<br><br>The deed is, but no doer of the deed is there;<br><br>Nibbāna is, but not the man that enters it;<br><br>The path is, but no traveler on it is seen.\"<br><br>(Vis.M. XVI)<br><br> <br><br>Literature: For texts on Nibbāna, see Path, 36ff. - See Vis.M. XVI. 64ff. - Anattā and Nibbāna, by Nyanaponika Thera (WHEEL 11); The Buddhist Doctrine of Nibbāna, by Ven. P.

In full clarity, it will appear in the mind by successful practice of certain concentration-exercises and will then appear as vividly as if seen by the eye. The object perceived at the very beginning of concentration is called the preparatory image (<i>parikamma-nimitta</i>). The still unsteady and unclear image, which arises when the mind has reached a weak degree of concentration, is called the acquired image (<i>uggaha-nimitta</i>). An entirely clear and immovable image arising at a higher degree of concentration is the counter-image (<i>paṭibhāga-nimitta</i>).

Also, when in explanation of <i>animitta </i>-<i>cetovimutti</i>, signless deliverance of mind (s. <i>cetovimutti</i>, <i>vimokkha</i>), it is said, '<i>sabbanimittānaṃ amanasikārā</i>', it refers to the 6 sense-objects (Com. to M. 43 [<i>Saḷāyatanavagga-aṭṭhakathā</i>]), and has therefore to be rendered \"by paying no attention to any object (or object-ideas).\" - A pleasant or beautiful object (<i>subha</i>-<i>nimitta</i>, q.v.) is a condition to the arising of the hindrance of sense-desire; a 'repellent object' (<i>paṭigha-nimitta</i>) for the hindrance of ill-will; contemplation on the impurity of an object (<i>asubha</i>-<i>nimitta</i>; s. <i>asubha</i>) is an antidote to sense-desire.<br><br>5.

XIV, 11), also called <i>saññāvedayitanirodha</i>, 'extinction of feeling and perception', is the temporary suspension of all consciousness and mental activity, following immediately upon the semi-conscious state called 'sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception' (s. <i>jhāna</i>, 8). The absolutely necessary pre-conditions to its attainment are said to be perfect mastery of all the 8 absorptions (<i>jhāna</i>), as well as the previous attainment of <i>Anāgāmi</i> or Arahatship (s. <i>ariya-puggala</i>).<br><br>According to Vis.M. XXIII, the entering into this state takes place in the following way: by means of mental tranquillity (<i>samatha</i>) and insight (<i>vipassanā</i>) one has to pass through all the 8 absorptions one after the other up to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and then one has to bring this state to an end. If, namely, according to the Vis.M., the disciple (<i>Anāgāmi</i> or <i>Arahat</i>) passes through the absorption merely by means of tranquillity, i.e. concentration, he will only attain the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and then come to a standstill; if, on the other hand, he proceeds only with insight, he will reach the fruition (<i>phala</i>) of Anāgāmī or Arahatship. He, however, who by means of both faculties has risen from absorption to absorption and, having made the necessary preparations, brings the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception to an end, such a one reaches the state of extinction. Whilst the disciple is passing through the 8 absorptions, he each time emerges from the absorption attained, and regards with his insight all the mental phenomena constituting that special absorption, as impermanent, miserable and impersonal. Then he again enters the next higher absorption, and thus, after each absorption practising insight, he at last reaches the state of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and thereafter the full extinction. This state, according to the Com., may last for 7 days or even longer. Immediately at the rising from this state, however, there arises in the Anāgāmi the fruition of Anāgāmiship (<i>Anāgāmi-phala</i>), in the Arahat the fruition of Arahatship (<i>Arahatta-phala</i>).<br><br>With regard to the difference existing between the monk abiding in this state of extinction on the one hand, and a dead person on the other hand, M 43 says: \"In him who is dead, and whose life has come to an end, the bodily (in-and-outbreathing), verbal (thought-conception and discursive thinking), and mental functions (s. <i>saṅkhāra</i>, 2) have become suspended and come to a standstill, life is exhausted, the vital heat extinguished, the faculties are destroyed. Also in the monk who has reached 'extinction of perception and feeling' (<i>saññāvedayitanirodha</i>), the bodily, verbal and mental functions have been suspended and come to a standstill, but life is not exhausted, the vital heat not extinguished, and the faculties are not destroyed.\"<br><br>For details, see Vis.M.

Canon, though the teaching of dependency of the 6 kinds of <i>viññāṇa</i> on the 6 sense-objects is an integral part of the suttas.

Canon (esp. Patth.). The 4 <i>adhipati</i> are in the suttas called <i>iddhipāda</i> (e.g. S. LI. 11). In the old sutta texts, 3 <i>adhipateyya</i> are however mentioned: <i>atta-</i>, <i>loka-</i>, <i>dhamma-</i> (A. III, 38).<br><br>4. & 5. <i>Anantara-</i> and <i>samanantara-paccaya</i> occur, as <i>paccaya</i>, for the first time in the Abh. Canon (esp. Patth.). In a veiled form, however, we find the first term in the old sutta texts (e.g. Ratana Sutta in Khp. and Sn.): ' <i>samādhiṃ</i> <i>ānantarikaññamāhu</i> ': the concentration (associated with the <i>arahatta-magga</i>), which is called the 'immediate' condition (for <i>arahatta-phala</i>).<br><br>6. & 7. <i>Sahajāta</i> and <i>aññamañña-paccaya</i>. Though these terms, as such, are not found in the older sutta texts, still the teaching of the conascent and mutual conditionedness of the 4 mental groups (<i>vedanā</i>, <i>saññā</i>, <i>saṅkhāra</i>, <i>viññāṇa</i>) is taught in the old texts, e.g. M. 28, 43; S. XXII, etc.<br><br>8. <i>Nissaya-paccaya</i> is mentioned in Pts; s. first paragraph of this article, above.<br><br>9. <i>Upanissaya-paccaya</i>. Though this name is not found in the suttas, the teaching expressed thereby is, however, frequently met with there, sometimes even in the form of <i>upanisā</i> (apparently a contraction of <i>upanissaya</i>), e.g. S. XII, 23: ' <i>Yaṃ</i> <i>pi'ssa</i> <i>taṃ</i> <i>bhikkhave</i> <i>khayasmiṃ</i> <i>khaye</i> <i>ñāṇaṃ</i>, <i>taṃ</i> <i>sa-upanisaṃ</i> <i>vadāmi</i>, <i>no</i> <i>anupanisaṃ</i> '. The terms <i>pakati-</i>, <i>ārammaṇa-</i> and <i>anantara-upanissaya</i> are later developments of the Abh. Com.<br><br>All the remaining terms are met with only in the Abh. literature though the substance is, perhaps in all cases, already dealt with in the old sutta texts."

        "'condition', is something on which something else, the so-called 'conditioned thing', is dependent, and without which the latter cannot be.

Non-disappearance \": <i>avigata</i> <i>paccaya</i><br><br> <br><br>(1) Root-condition (<i>hetu-paccaya</i>) is that condition that resembles the root of a tree. Just as a tree rests on its root, and remains alive only as long as its root is not destroyed, similarly all kammically wholesome and unwholesome mental states are entirely dependent on the simultaneity and presence of their respective roots, i.e, of greed (<i>lobha</i>), hate (<i>dosa</i>), delusion (<i>moha</i>), or greedlessness (<i>alobha</i>), hatelessness (<i>adosa</i>), undeludedness (<i>amoha</i>). For the definition of these 6 roots, s. <i>mūla</i>.<br><br>\"The roots are a condition by way of root for the (mental) phenomena associated with a root, and for the corporeal phenomena produced thereby (e.g. for bodily expression)\" (Patth).<br><br>(2) Object-condition (<i>ārammaṇa-paccaya</i>) is called something which, as object, forms the condition for consciousness and mental phenomena. Thus, the physical object of sight consisting in colour and light ('light-wave'), is the necessary condition and the sine qua non for the arising of eye-consciousness (<i>cakkhu-viññāṇa</i>), etc.; sound ('sound wave') for ear-consciousness (<i>sotā-viññāṇa</i>), etc.; further, any object arising in the mind is the condition for mind-consciousness (<i>mano-viññāṇa</i>). The mind-object may be anything whatever, corporeal or mental, past, present or future, real or imaginary.<br><br>(3) Predominance-condition (<i>adhipati-paccaya</i>) is the term for 4 things, on the preponderance and predominance of which are dependent the mental phenomena associated with them, namely: concentrated intention (<i>chanda</i>, q.v.), energy (<i>viriya</i>, q.v.), consciousness (<i>citta</i>) and investigation (<i>vīmaṃsā</i>). In one and the same state of consciousness, however, only one of these 4 phenomena can be predominant at a time. \"Whenever such phenomena as consciousness and mental concomitants are arising by giving preponderance to one of these 4 things, then this phenomenon is for the other phenomena a condition by way of predominance\" (Patth.). Cf. <i>iddhi-pāda</i>.<br><br>(4-5) Proximity and contiguity (or immediacy)-condition (<i>anantara</i> and <i>samanantara-paccaya</i>) - both being identical - refer to any state of consciousness and mental phenomena associated with them, which are the conditions for the immediately following stage in the process of consciousness. For example, in the visual process, eye-consciousness is for the immediately following mindelement - performing the function of receiving the visible object - a condition by way of contiguity; and so is this mind-element for the next following mind-consciousness element, performing the function of investigating the object, etc. Cf. <i>viññāṇa-kicca</i>.<br><br>(6) Co-nascence condjtion (<i>sahajāta-paccaya</i>), i.e. condition by way of simultaneous arising, is a phenomenon that for another one forms, a condition in such a way that, simultaneously with its arising, also the other thing must arise. Thus, for instance, in one and the same moment each of the 4 mental groups (feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness) is for the 3 other groups a condition by way of co-nascence or co-arising; or again each of the 4 physical elements (solid, liquid, heat, motion) is such a condition for the other 3 elements. Only at the moment of conception in the mother's womb does corporeality (physical base of mind) serve for the 4 mental groups as a condition by way of conascence.<br><br>(7) Condition by way of mutuality (<i>aññāmañña-paccaya</i>). All the just mentioned associated and co-nascent mental phenomena, as well as the 4 physical elements, are, of course, at the same time also conditioned by way of mutuality, \"just like three sticks propped up one by another.\" The 4 mental groups are one for another a condition by way of mutuality. So also are the 4 elements, and also mentality and corporeality at the moment of conception.<br><br>(8) Support-condition (<i>nissaya-paccaya</i>). This condition refers either to a pre-nascent (s. 10) or co-nascent (s. 6) phenomenon which is aiding other phenomena in the manner of a foundation or base, just as the trees have the earth as their foundation, or as the oil-painting rests on the canvas. In this way, the 5 sense-organs and the physical base of the mind are for the corresponding 6 kinds of consciousness a prenascent, i.e. previously arisen, condition by way of support. Further all co-nascent (s. 6) phenomena are mutually (s. 7) conditioned by each other by way of support.<br><br>(9) Decisive-support (or inducement) condition (<i>upanissaya-paccaya</i>) is threefold, namely (a) by way of object (<i>ārammaṇūpanissaya-paccaya</i>), (b) by way of proximity (<i>anantarūpanissaya</i>), (c) natural decisive support (<i>pakatupanissaya</i>). These conditions act as strong inducement or cogent reason.<br><br>(a) Anything past, present or future, corporeal or mental, real or imaginary, may, as object of our thinking, become a decisive support, or strong inducement, to moral, immoral or kammically neutral states of mind. Evil things, by wrong thinking about them, become an inducement to immoral life; by right thinking, an inducement to moral life. But good things may be an inducement not only to similarly good things, but also to bad things, such as self-conceit, vanity, envy, etc.<br><br>(b;) is identical with proximity condition (No. 4).<br><br>(c) Faith, virtue, etc., produced in one's own mind, or the influence of climate, food, etc., on one's body and mind, may act as natural and decisive support-conditions. Faith may be a direct and natural inducement to charity, virtue to mental training, etc.; greed to theft, hate to murder; unsuitable food and climate to ill-health; friends to spiritual progress or deterioration.<br><br>(10) Pre-nascence-condition (<i>purejāta</i>-<i>paccaya</i>) refers to something previously arisen, which forms a base for something arising later on. For example, the 5 physical sense-organs and the physical base of mind, having already arisen at the time of birth, form the condition for the consciousness arising later, and for the mental phenomena associated therewith.<br><br>(11) Post-nascence-condition (<i>pacchā-jāta-paccaya</i>) refers to consciousness and the phenomena therewith associated, because they are - just as is the feeling of hunger- a necessary condition for the preservation of this already arisen body.<br><br>(12) Repetition-condition (<i>āsevana-paccaya</i>) refers to the kammical consciousness, in which each time the preceding impulsive moments (<i>javana-citta</i>, q.v.) are for all the succeeding ones a condition by way of repetition and frequency, just as in learning by heart, through constant repetition, the later recitation becomes gradually easier and easier.<br><br>(13) Kamma-condition (<i>kamma-paccaya</i>). The pre-natal kamma (i.e kamma-volitions, <i>kamma-cetanā</i>, in a previous birth) is the generating condition (cause) of the 5 sense-organs, the fivefold sense-consciousness, and the other kamma-produced mental and corporeal phenomena in a later birth. - Kammical volition is also a condition by way of kamma for the co-nascent mental phenomena associated therewith, but these phenomena are in no way kamma-results.<br><br>(14) Kamma-result-condition (<i>vipāka-paccaya</i>). The kamma-resultant 5 kinds of sense-consciousness are a condition by way of kamma-result for the co-nascent mental and corporeal phenomena.<br><br>(15) Nutriment-condition (<i>āhāra-paccaya</i>). For the 4 nutriments, s. <i>āhāra</i>.<br><br>(16) Faculty-condition (<i>indriya-paccaya</i>). This condition applies to 20 faculties (<i>indriya</i>, q.v.), leaving out No. 7 and 8 from the 22 faculties. Of these 20 faculties, the 5 physical sense-organs (1 - 5), in their capacity as faculties, form a condition only for uncorporeal phenomena (eye-consciousness etc.); physical vitality (6) and all the remaining faculties, for the co-nascent mental and corporeal phenomena.<br><br>(17) <i>Jhāna</i>-condition (<i>jhāna-paccaya</i>) is a name for the 7 so-called jhāna-factors, as these form a condition to the co-nascent mental and corporeal phenomena, to wit: (1) thought-conception (<i>vitakka</i>), (2) discursive thinking (<i>vicāra</i>), (3) interest (<i>pīti</i>), (4) joy (<i>sukha</i>), (5) sadness (<i>domanassa</i>), (6) indifference (<i>upekkhā</i>), (7) concentration (<i>samādhi</i>). (For definition s. <i>Pāḷi</i> terms. )<br><br>1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in 4 classes of greedy consciousness (s. Tab. I. 22-25); 1, 2, 5, 7 in hateful consciousness (ib. 30, 31); 1, 2, 6, 7 in the classes of deluded consciousness (ib. 32, 33).<br><br>This condition does not only apply to jhāna alone, but also to the general intensifying ('absorbing') impact of these 7 factors.<br><br>(18) Path-condition (<i>magga-paccaya</i>) refers to the 12 path-factors, as these are for the kammically wholesome and unwholesome mental phenomena associated with them, a way of escape from this or that mental constitution, namely: (1) knowledge (<i>paññā</i> = <i>sammādiṭṭhi</i>, right understanding), (2) (right or wrong) thought-conception (<i>vitakka</i>), (3) right speech (<i>sammā-vācā</i>), (4) right bodily action (<i>sammā-kammanta</i>), (5) right livelihood (<i>sammā-ājīva</i>), (6) (right or wrong) energy (<i>viriya</i>), (7) (right or wrong) mindfulness (<i>sati</i>), (8) (right or wrong) concentration (<i>samādhi</i>), (9) wrong views (<i>micchādiṭṭhi</i>), (10) wrong speech (<i>micchā-vācā</i>), (11) wrong bodily action (<i>micchā-kammanta</i>), (12) wrong livelihood (<i>micchā-ājīva</i>). Cf. <i>magga</i>.<br><br>(19) Association-condition (<i>sampayutta-paccaya</i>) refers to the co-nascent (s. 6) and mutually (s. 7) conditioned 4 mental groups (<i>khandha</i>), \"as they aid each other by their being associated, by having a common physical base, a common object, and by their arising and disappearing simultaneously\" (Patth. Com.).<br><br>(20) Dissociation-condition (<i>vippayutta-paccaya</i>) refers to such phenomena as aid other phenomena by not baving the same physical base (eye, etc.) and objects. Thus corporeal phenomena are for mental phenomena, and conversely, a condition by way of dissociation, whether co-nascent or not.<br><br>(2l) Presence-condition (<i>atthi-paccaya</i>) refers to a phenomenon - being pre-nascent or co-nascent - which through its presence is a condition for other phenomena. This condition applies to the conditions Nos. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11.<br><br>(22) Absence-condition (<i>natthi-paccaya</i>) refers to consciousness, etc., which has just passed, and which thus forms the necessary condition for the immediately following stage of consciousness by giving it an opportunity to arise. Cf. No. 4.<br><br>(23) Disappearance-condition (<i>vigata-paccaya</i>) is identical with No. 22.<br><br>(24) Non-disappearance-condition (<i>avigata-paccaya</i>) is identical with No. 21.<br><br>These 24 conditions should be known thoroughly for a detailed understanding of that famous formula of the dependent origination (<i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i>, q.v.).

The former or analytical method is applied in <i>Dhammasaṅganī</i>, the first book of the <i>Abhidhamma</i> <i>Piṭaka</i>; the latter or synthetical method, in <i>Paṭṭhāna</i>, the last book of the <i>Abhidhamma</i> <i>Piṭaka</i>.

For a thorough understanding of the <i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i> he should know the main modes of conditioning, as decisive support, co-nascence, pre-nascence, etc.<br><br>For a closer study of the subject should be consulted: Vis.M. XVII; Fund. III; Guide (Ch. VII and Appendix); Dependent Origination, by <i>Piyadassi Thera</i> (WHEEL 15); The Significance of Dependent Origination (WHEEL 140).<br><br> <br><br>(1.) \"Through ignorance are conditioned the kamma-formations\" (<i>avijjā-paccayā</i> <i>saṅkhārā</i>), i.e. all wholesome and unwholesome actions (kamma, q.v.) of body, speech and mind, are conditioned through ignorance. By 'kamma-formations' are meant kammically wholesome and unwholesome volitions (<i>cetanā</i>), or volitional activities, in short kamma (q.v., and Fund. II).<br><br>In view of the many misconceptions current in the West, it is necessary to repeat here that kamma (q.v.), as a technical term, never signifies anything but moral or immoral action, i.e. the above mentioned volitional activities, or kamma-formations, as either causing results in the present life or being the causes of future destiny and rebirth. Thus kamma, as a philosophical term, never means the result of action, as often wrongly conceived by Western authors.<br><br>Now, in what way are the kamma-formations conditioned through ignorance? As concerns the unwholesome kammaformations associated with greed, hate or delusion (<i>lobha</i>, <i>dosa</i>, <i>moha</i>), these are always and in all circumstances, conditioned through the simultaneous ignorance inseparably associated therewith. Thus, ignorance is for the unwholesome kamma-formations a condition by way of conascence (<i>sahajāta-paccaya</i>), association (<i>sampayutta-paccaya</i>), presence (<i>atthi-paccaya</i>), etc. Ignorance further may be for them a condition by way of decisive support or inducement (<i>upanissaya-paccaya</i>), if, for instance, ignorance coupled with greed induces a man to commit evil deeds, such as killing, stealing, unlawful sexual intercourse, etc. In these cases, therefore, ignorance is a 'natural decisive suppport' or 'direct inducement' (pakati-<i>upanissaya-paccaya</i>). It also may become an indirect inducement, by way of object (<i>ārammaṇūpanissaya-paccaya</i>) of our thinking. This takes place, if, for example, someone remembers a former state of ignorance combined with sensual enjoyment, and in doing so kammically unwholesome states spring up, such as sensual desire, grief, etc.<br><br>For the wholesome (<i>kusala</i>) kamma-formations, ignorance can only be a condition by way of decisive support (<i>upanissaya</i>), never by way of co-nascence (<i>sahajāta</i>), etc., since wholesome consciousness at that very moment, of course, cannot be associated with any unwholesome phenomenon, such as ignorance. Ignorance is a 'natural decisive support' or 'direct inducement' (<i>pakatupanissaya</i>), for example, if, induced by ignorance and vanity, one exerts oneself to attain the absorptions, and thus finally, through perseverance, reaches these wholesome states of mind. Ignorance may also be for wholesome kamma-formations a 'decisive support' or 'inducement by way of object' (<i>ārammaṇūpanissaya</i>), if, for example, one refleets on ignorance as the root of all misery in the world, and thus finally attains insight and entrance into one of the 4 supermundane paths of holiness.<br><br>For ignorance, s. <i>avijjā</i>; for kamma-formations, s. <i>saṅkhāra</i>.<br><br> <br><br>(2.) \"Through the kamma-formations is conditioned consciousness\" (<i>Saṅkhāra-paccayā viññāṇaṃ</i>). This proposition teaches that the wholesome and unwholesome kamma-formations are the causes of future rebirth in an appropriate sphere (<i>gati</i>). The kamma-formations of the previous life condition the budding in a new mother's womb of a fresh psycho-physical aggregation of the 5 groups of existence (s. <i>khandha</i>), which here are represented by consciousness (<i>viññāṇa</i>). All such kamma-resultant (<i>vipāka</i>) consciousness, however, such as eye-consciousness (seeing), etc., as well as all the mental phenomena associated therewith (feeling, etc.), are kammically neutral. It should be understood that already from the very first moment of conception in the mother's womb, this kamma resultant eonsciousness of the embryonic being is functioning.<br><br>Against Dr. Paul Dahlke's misconception of the <i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i> as \"one single kammical moment of personal experience,\" and of the 'simultaneity' of all the 12 links of this formula, I should like to state here distinctly that the interpretation of the <i>p.</i> given here as comprising 3 successive lives not only agrees with all the different schools of Buddhism and all the ancient commentaries, but also is fully identical with the explanations given already in the canonical <i>Suttas </i>. Thus, for example, it is said verbatim in <i>Nidāna-saṃyutta</i> (S. XII, 51): \"Once ignorance (1) and clinging (9) are extinguished, neither kammically meritorious, nor demeritorious, nor imperturbable kamma-formations (2=10) are produced, and thus no consciousness (3=11) will spring up again in a new mother's womb.\" And further: \"For, if consciousness were not to appear in the mother's womb, would in that case mentality and corporeality (4) arise?\" Cf. above diagram.<br><br>The purpose of the Buddha in teaching the<i> p.</i> was to show to suffering mankind how, depending on ignorance and delusion, this present existence and suffering has come about, and how through extinction of ignorance, and of the craving and clinging conditioned thereby, no more rebirth will follow, and thus the standstill of the process of existence will have been realized and therewith the extinction of all suffering.<br><br> <br><br>(3.) \"Through consciousness are conditioned corporeality and mentality\" (<i>viññāṇa-paccayā</i> <i>nāma-rūpani</i>). This proposition implies that without consciousness there ean be no mental and physical process of existence. By mentality (<i>nāma</i>) is here to be understood the kamma-resultant (<i>vipāka</i>) mental phenomena, such as feeling (<i>vedanā</i>), perception (<i>saññā</i>), volition (<i>cetanā</i>: non-kammical volition is here meant), consciousness-impression (<i>phassa</i>), advertence (<i>manasikāra</i>) (M. 9; S. XII, 2). For the basic 7 mental phenomena inseparably associated with every state of consciousness, s. <i>nāma</i>. By corporeality (<i>rūpa</i>) is meant the 4 physical elements (s. <i>dhātu</i>) and the corporeality dependent thereon (s. <i>khandha</i>, I).<br><br>Mentality is always conditioned through consciousness; i.e. consciousness (<i>viññāṇa</i>) is for mentality (<i>nāma</i>) a condition by way of conascence (<i>sahajāta</i>), mutuality (<i>aññamañña</i>), association (<i>sampayutta</i>), etc., since the 4 mental groups at all times form an inseparable unit.<br><br>Consciousness (<i>viññāṇa</i>) is for corporeality (<i>rūpa</i>) a condition by way of co-nascence only at the moment of conception, thereafter a condition by way of post-nascence (<i>pacchājāta-paccaya</i>; <i>paccaya</i> 11) and nutriment (<i>āhāra</i>), i.e. as a support. Just as the repeatedly arising hunger is a condition and support for the pre-arisen body, so is the conseiousness arising afterwards a condition and support for the maintenance of this pre-arisen body.<br><br> <br><br>(4.) \"Through mentality and corporeality are conditioned the 6 bases (<i>nāma-rūpa</i> paccayā sal<i>āyatana</i>m). The 6 bases are a name for the 5 physical sense-organs and, as 6th, the mind-base (<i>manāyatana</i>), i.e. consciousness.<br><br>Mentality (<i>nāma</i>; s. 3) is for the 5 physical bases (<i>āyatana</i>), or sense-organs, a condition by way of post-nascence. Cf. end of 3.<br><br>Mentality (<i>nāma</i>), i.e. feeling. etc., is for the 6th base, or consciousness - as being always inseparably associated therewith a condition by way of co-nascencc. etc.<br><br>Corporeality (<i>rūpa</i>), here the 4 elements, are for the 5 physical bases (<i>āyatana</i>), or sense-organs, a condition by way of support (<i>nissaya</i>).<br><br>Corporeality (<i>rūpa</i>), here the 5 physical sense-organs, are for the 6th base (<i>āyatana</i>), i.e. consciousness, a condition by way of support and pre-nascence (<i>purejāta</i>-<i>paccaya</i>).<br><br> <br><br>(5.) \"Through the 6 bases is conditioned the (sensorial and mental) impression\" (<i>Saḷāyatana-paccayā phasso</i>), for without the 5 physical bases, or sense-organs, there can be no sense-impressions; and without the 6th base, or consciousness, there can be no mental impression.<br><br>Thus, the 5 physical bases, eye, etc., are for the corresponding 5 sense-impressions (visual impression, etc.) a condition by way of support (<i>nissaya</i>) and pre-nascence (<i>purejāta</i>), whereas the 6th, the mind-base (consciousness), is for the mental impression a condition by way of co-nascence, association, mutuality, etc.<br><br> <br><br>(6.) \"Through impression is conditioned feeling\" (<i>Phassa-paccayā vedanā</i>), i.e. the sensorial and the mental impressions are for the feeling associated therewith a condition by way of co-nascence, association, mutuality, etc.<br><br> <br><br>(7.) \"Through feeling is conditioned craving\" (<i>Vedanā-paccayā taṇhā</i>). Any (kamma-resultant) feeling, whether agreeable, disagreeable or neutral, bodily or mental, past or expected, may become for craving a condition of decisive support by way of object (<i>ārammanūpanissaya</i>). Even physically and mentally painful feeling may, through the desire to be released therefrom, become for craving a condition of decisive support by way of object (<i>ārammanupanissaya</i>).<br><br> <br><br>(8.) \"Through craving is conditioned clinging\" (<i>Taṇhā-paccayā upādānaṃ</i>). 'Clinging' is explained as an intensified form of craving. It is of 4 kinds: (1) clinging to sensuality, (2) to erroneous views, (3) to rules and ritual, (4) to personality-belief. Sensuous craving is to (1) a condition of natural decisive support (<i>pakatupanissaya</i>). For (2-4), craving is a condition by way of co-nascence, mutuality, root (<i>hetu</i>), etc. It also may be a condition of natural decisive support. For example, through craving for heavenly rebirth, etc. people often may be induced to cling to certain rules and rituals, with the hope of reaching thereby the object of their desires.<br><br> <br><br>(9.) \"Through clinging is conditioned the process of becoming\" (<i>Upādāna-paccayā bhavo</i>), i.e. the wholesome and unwholesome active kamma-process of becoming (<i>kamma-bhava</i>), as well as the kamma-resultant (<i>vipāka</i>) passive process, the so-called 'rebirth-process' (<i>upapatti-bhava</i>). The kamma-process (<i>kammabhava</i>) comprises the 5 kammical causes: ignorance, kamma-formations, craving, clinging, kamma-process (s. 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, of the diagram); the rebirth-process (<i>upapatti-bhava</i>) comprises the 5 kamma-results (s. 3-7 of the diagram).<br><br>The kamma-process is here, correctly speaking, a collective name for generative karmic volition (<i>kamma-cetanā</i>) and all the mental phenomena associated therewith, whilst the 2nd link (kamma-formations) designates only karmic volition (s. <i>āyūhana</i>). Both, however, i.e. the 2nd and 10th proposition, practically state one and the same thing, namely, that kamma is the cause of rebirth, as we shall see under 10.<br><br>Clinging (<i>upādāna</i>) may be an inducement of decisive support (<i>upanissaya</i>) to many kinds of wholesome and unwholesome kamma. Sensuous clinging (<i>kāmūpādāna</i>), i.e. clinging to sensuous objects, for example, may be a direct inducement to murder, theft, unlawful intercourse with the other sex, evil words and thoughts, etc. Clinging to rules and ritual (<i>sīla</i>bbatūpā<i>dāna</i>) may lead to self-complacency, fanaticism, cruelty, etc. Clinging is also for the evil kamma associated therewith, a condition by way of co-nascence, association, etc.<br><br> <br><br>(10.) \"Through the process of becoming is conditioned rebirth\" (<i>Bhava-paccayā jāti</i>), i.e. through the wholesome and unwholesome kamma-process (<i>kamma-bhava</i>) is conditioned the rebirth-process (<i>upapatti-bhava</i>). The 2nd and 10th propositions, as already pointed out, practically teach one and the same thing, namely, that kamma is the cause of rebirth; in other words, that the kammical volition (<i>cetanā</i>) is the seed out of which springs the new life, just as from the mango-seed is generated the new mango-tree.<br><br>Hence, the 5 kammical causes (ignorance, etc.) of the past birth are the condition for the kamma-results of the present birth; and the 5 kammical causes of the present birth are the condition for the 5 kamma-results of the next birth (s. diagram). As it is said in Vis.M. XVII:<br><br>\"Five causes were there in the past,<br><br>Five fruits we find in present life;<br><br>Five causes do we now produce,<br><br>Five fruits we reap in future life.\"<br><br> <br><br>Now, just as in this process of continually changing mental and bodily phenomena, nothing can be found that would pass from one moment to the next moment, so also there is no enduring entity, ego, or personality, within this process of existence that would transmigrate from one life to the next (s. <i>nāma-rūpa</i>, <i>anattā</i>, <i>paṭisandhi</i>, <i>khandha</i>). \"No being and no living soul passed from the former life to this life, and yet this present embryo could not have entered into existence without the preceding causes\" (Vis.M. XVII). \"Many things may serve to illustrate this fact, as for example the echo, the light of a lamp, the impression of a seal, or the image produced by a mirror\" (ib.).<br><br>\"Whosoever is in the dark with regard to the conditionally arisen things, and does not understand that kamma originates from ignorance, etc., he thinks that it must be his ego that knows or does not know, acts and causes to act, and that arises at rebirth. Or he thinks that the atoms, or a creator, with the help of this embryonic process, must have formed this body, or that it is the ego endowed with faculties that has impressions, feels, desires, clings, continues and enters again into existence in a new birth. Or he thinks that all beings have been born through fate, or fortuitously\" (Vis.M. XVII).<br><br>Now, on hearing that Buddhism teaches that everything whatever in the world is determined by conditions some might come to the conclusion that Buddhism teaches some sort of fatalism, and that man has no free will, or that will is not free.<br><br>The problem 'whether man has a free will' does not exist for, the Buddhist, since he knows that, apart from these everchanging mental and physical phenomena, no such entity as 'man' can be found, and that 'man' is merely a name not relating to any reality. And the question, 'whether will is free', must be rejected for the reason that 'will', or volition, is a mental phenomenon flashing forth only for a moment, and that as such it had not any existence at the preceding moment. For of a thing which is not, or is not yet, one cannot, properly speaking, ask whether it is free or unfree. The only admissible question would be whether the arising of 'will' is independent of conditions, or whether it is conditioned. But the same question would equally apply also to all the other mental phenomena, as well as to all physical phenomena, in other words: to everything and every occurrence whatever. And the answer would be: whether will arises, or whether feeling arises, or whether any other mental or any physical phenomenon arises, the arising of anything whatsoever is dependent on conditions, and without conditions nothing ever can arise or enter into existence.<br><br>According to Buddhism, everything mental or physical happens in accordance with laws and conditions; and if it were otherwise, chaos and blind chance would reign. But such a thing is impossible and contradicts all laws of thinking. Cf. Fund. III (end). <br><br>(11.) \"Through rebirth are conditioned old age and death\" (<i>jātipaccayā jarā-maraṇaṃ</i>). Without birth there can be no old age and death, no suffering and misery. Thus rebirth is to old age and death, etc. a condition by way of decisive support (<i>upanissaya</i>).<br><br>The Buddha has said (D. 15): \"Profound, <i>Ānanda</i>. is this dependent origination, and profound does it appear. It is through not understanding, not penetrating, this law that this world resembles a tangled ball of thread, a bird's nest, a thicket of sedge or reed, and that man does not escape from the lower states of existence, from the course of woe and perdition, suffering from the round of rebirth.\" And further (M. 28): 'Whoso understands the dependent origination understands the Dhamma; and whoso understands the Dhamma understands the dependent origination.\""

Through the complete fading away and cessation of the field of sixfold sense-impression, there comes about the cessation and the coming-to-rest of the world of diffuseness (<i>papañca-nirodho papañca-vupasamo</i>).\" The opposite term <i>nippapañca</i> is a name for Nibbāna (S.

The Buddha, in explaining his doctrine, sometimes used conventional language and sometimes the philosophical mode of expression which is in accordance whith undeluded insight into reality. In that ultimate sense, existence is a mere process of physical and mental phenomena within which, or beyond which, no real ego-entity nor any abiding substance can ever be found. Thus, whenever the <i>Suttas </i>speak of man, woman or person, or of the rebirth of a being, this must not be taken as being valid in the ultimate sense, but as a mere conventional mode of speech (<i>vohāra-vacana</i>).<br><br>It is one of the main characteristics of the <i>Abhidhamma</i> <i>Piṭaka</i>, in distinction from most of the <i>Sutta</i> <i>Piṭaka</i>, that it does not employ conventional language, but deals only with ultimates, or realities in the highest sense (<i>paramattha-dhammā</i>).

Further, the Buddha repeatedly mentioned his reservations when using conventional speech, e.g. in D. 9: \"These are merely names, expressions, turns of speech, designations in common use in the world, which the Perfect Qne (<i>Tathāgata</i>) uses without misapprehending them.\" See also S.

(2) By avoiding to do them any harm, they observe morality (<i>sīla</i> q.v.). (3) In order to bring morality to perfection, they train themselves in renunciation (<i>nekkhamma</i>). (4) In order to understand clearly what is beneficial and injurious to beings, they purify their wisdom (<i>paññā</i>). (5) For the sake of the welfare and happiness of others they constantly exert their energy (<i>viriya</i>). (6) Though having become heroes through utmost energy, they are nevertheless full of forbearance (<i>khanti </i>) toward s the manifold failings of beings. (7) Once they have promised to give or do something, they do not break their promise ('truthfulness'; <i>sacca</i>). (8) With unshakable resolution (<i>adhiṭṭhāna</i>) they work for the weal and welfare of beings. (9) With unshakable kindness (<i>mettā</i>) they are helpful to all.

'perfect enlightenment'. The faith (<i>saddhā</i>, q.v.) of a lay follower of the Buddha is described as \"he believes in the enlightenment of the Perfect One\" (<i>saddahati Tathāgatassa bodhim</i>: M. 53, A. III, 2).<br><br>As components of the state of enlightenment and contributory factors to its achievement, are mentioned in the texts: the 7 factors of enlightenment (<i>bojjhaṅga</i> (q.v.)= <i>bodhi-aṅga</i>) and the 37 'things pertaining to enlightenment' (<i>bodhipakkhiya-dhammā</i>, q.v.). In one of the later books of the <i>Sutta Piṭaka</i>, the <i>Buddhavaṃsa</i>, 10 <i>bodhipācana-dhammā</i> are mentioned, i.e. qualities that lead to the ripening of perfect enlightenment; these are the 10 perfections (<i>pāramī</i>, q.v.).<br><br>There is a threefold classification of enlightenment: 1. that of a noble disciple (<i>sāvaka-bodhi</i>, q.v.). i.e. of an Arahat, 2. of an Independently Enlightened One (<i>pacceka-bodhi</i>, q.v.), and 3. of a Perfect Enlightened One (<i>sammā-sambodhi</i>). This 3-fold division, however, is of later origin, and in this form it neither occurs in the canonical texts nor in the older <i>Sutta</i> commentaries. The closest approximation to it is found in a verse <i>Sutta</i> which is probably of a comparatively later period, the Treasure Store <i>Sutta</i> (<i>Nidhikkanda Sutta</i>) of the <i>Khuddakapāṭha</i>, where the following 3 terms are mentioned in stanza 15: <i>sāvaka-pāramī</i>, <i>pacceka-bodhi</i>, <i>buddha-bhūmi </i>(see Khp. Tr., pp. 247f.).<br><br>The commentaries (e.g. to M., <i>Buddhavaṃsa</i>, <i>Cariya-piṭaka</i>) generally give a 4-fold explanation of the word bodhi: 1. the tree of enlightenment, 2. the holy path (<i>ariya-magga</i>), 3. Nibbāna, 4 omniscience (of the Buddha: <i>sabbaññutā-ñāṇa</i>). As to (2), the commentaries quote <i>Cūḷa Niddesa</i> where <i>bodhi</i> is defined as the knowledge relating to the 4 paths (of Stream-entry, etc.; <i>catūsu maggesu ñāṇa</i>).<br><br>Neither in the canonical texts nor in the old commentaries is it stated that a follower of the Buddha may choose between the three kinds of enlightenment and aspire either to become a Buddha, a Pacceka-Buddha, or an Arahat-disciple. This conception of a choice between three aspirations is, however, frequently found in present-day <i>Theravāda</i> countries, e.g. in Sri Lanka."

Herein, since time immemorial, all impressions and experiences are, as it were, stored up, or better said, are functioning, but concealed as such to- full consciousness, from where however they occasionally emerge as subconscious phenomena and approach the threshold of full consciousness, or crossing it become fully conscious. This so-called 'subconscious life-stream' or undercurrent of life is that by which might be explained the faculty of memory, paranormal psychic phenomena, mental and physical growth, kamma and rebirth. etc. An alternative rendering is 'life-continuum'.<br><br>It should be noted that <i>bhavaṅga-citta</i> is a kamma-resultant state of consciousness (<i>vipāka</i>, q.v.), and that, in birth as a human or in higher forms of existence, it is always the result of good, or wholesome kamma (<i>kusala-kamma-vipāka</i>), though in varying degrees of strength (s. <i>paṭisandhi</i>, end of the article). The same holds true for rebirth consciousness (<i>paṭisandhi</i>) and death consciousness (<i>cuti</i>), which are only particular manifestations of subconsciousness. In Vis.M. XIV it is said:<br><br>\"As soon as rebirth-consciousness (in the embryo at the time of conception) has ceased, there arises a similar subconsciousness with exactly the same object, following immediately upon rebirth-consciousness and being the result of this or that kamma (volitional action done in a former birth and remembered there at the moment before death). And again a further similar state of subconsciousness arises. Now, as long as no other consciousness arises to interrupt the continuity of the life-stream, so long the life-stream, like the flow of a river, rises in the same way again and again, even during dreamless sleep and at other times. In this way one has to understand the continuous arising of those states of consciousness in the life-stream.\" Cf. <i>viññāṇa-kicca</i>. For more details, s. Fund. 11. (App.)."

Concentration (<i>samādhi</i>) is the indispensable foundation and precondition of insight by purifying the mind from the 5 mental defilements or hindrances (<i>nīvaraṇa</i>, q.v.), whilst insight (<i>vipassanā</i>) produces the 4 supra mundane stages of holiness and deliverance of mind.

The latter is associated with those states of consciousness known as the 4 supermundane paths and fruitions (s. <i>ariya-puggala</i>). As it is said in M. 117:<br><br>\"I tell you, o monks, there are 2 kinds of right view: the understanding that it is good to give alms and offerings, that both good and evil actions will bear fruit and will be followed by results.... This, o monks, is a view which, though still subject to the cankers, is meritorious, yields worldly fruits, and brings good results. But whatever there is of wisdom, of penetration, of right view conjoined with the path - the holy path being pursued, this is called the supermundane right view (<i>lokuttara-sammā-diṭṭhi</i>), which is not of the world, but which is supermundane and conjoined with the path.\"<br><br>In a similar way the remaining links of the path are to be understood.<br><br>As many of those who have written about the Eightfold Path have misunderstood its true nature, it is therefore appropriate to add here a few elucidating remarks about it, as this path is fundamental for the understanding and practice of the Buddha's.teaching.<br><br>First of all, the figurative expression 'path' should not be interpreted to mean that one has to advance step by step in the sequence of the enumeration until, after successively passing through all the eight stages, one finally may reach one's destination, Nibbāna. If this really were the case, one should have realized, first of all, right view and penetration of the truth, even before one could hope to proceed to the next steps, right thought and right speech; and each preceding stage would be the indispensable foundation and condition for each succeeding stage. In reality, however, the links 3-5 constituting moral training (<i>sīla</i>), are the first 3 links to be cultivated, then the links 6-8 constituting mental training (<i>samādhi</i>), and at last right view, etc. constituting wisdom (<i>paññā</i>).<br><br>It is, however, true that a really unshakable and safe foundation to the path is provided only by right view which, starting from the tiniest germ of faith and knowledge, gradually, step by step, develops into penetrating insight (<i>vipassanā</i>) and thus forms the immediate condition for the entrance into the 4 supermundane paths and fruits of holiness, and for the realization of Nibbāna. Only with regard to this highest form of supermundane insight, may we indeed say that all the remaining links of the path are nothing but the outcome and the accompaniments of right view.<br><br>Regarding the mundane (<i>lokiya</i>) eightfold path, however, its links may arise without the first link, right view.<br><br>Here it must also be emphasized that the links of the path not only do not arise one after the other, as already indicated, but also that they, at least in part, arise simultaneously as inseparably associated mental factors in one and the same state of consciousness. Thus, for instance, under all circumstances at least 4 links are inseparably bound up with any kammically wholesome consciousness, namely 2, 6, 7 and 8, i.e. right thought, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration (M. 117), so that as soon as any one of these links arises, the three others also do so.

About this momentaneity of existence, it is said in Vis.M. VIII:<br><br>\"In the absolute sense, beings have only a very short moment to live, life lasting as long as a single moment of consciousness lasts. Just as a cart-wheel, whether rolling or whether at a standstill, at all times only rests on a single point of its periphery, even so the life of a living being lasts only for the duration of a single moment of consciousness. As soon as that moment ceases, the being also ceases. For it is said: 'The being of the past moment of consciousness has lived, but does not live now, nor will it live in future. The being of the future moment has not yet lived, nor does it live now, but it will live in the future. The being of the present moment has not lived, it does live just now, but it will not live in the future.' \"<br><br>In another sense, the coming to an end of the psycho-physical life-process of the Arahat, or perfectly Holy One, at the moment of his passing away may be called the final and ultimate death, as up to that moment the psycho-physical life-process was still going on from life to life.<br><br>Death, in the ordinary sense, combined with old age, forms the 12th link in the formula of dependent origination (<i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i> q.v.).<br><br>For death as a subject of meditation, s. <i>maraṇānussati</i>; as a function of consciousness, s. <i>viññāṇa-kicca</i>."

        "'recollection of death', is one of the 10 recollections treated in detail in Vis.M. VIII:<br><br>''Recollection of death, developed and frequently practised, yields great reward, great blessing, has Deathlessness as its goal and object. But how may such recollection be developed?<br><br>\"As soon as the day declines, or as the night vanishes and the day is breaking, the monk thus reflects: 'Truly, there are many possibilities for me to die: I may be bitten by a serpent, or be stung by a scorpion or a centipede, and thereby I may lose my life. But this would be an obstacle for me. Or I may stumble and fall to the ground, or the food eaten by me may not agree with my health; or bile, phlegm and piercing body gases may become disturbing, or men or ghosts may attack me, and thus I may lose my life. But this would be an obstacle for me.' Then the monk has to consider thus: 'Are there still to be found in me unsubdued evil, unwholesome things which, if I should die today or tonight, might lead me to suffering?' Now, if he understands that this is the case, he should use his utmost resolution, energy, effort, endeavour, steadfastness, attentiveness and clear-mindedness in order to overcome these evil, unwholesome things\" (A VIII, 74).<br><br>In Vis.M. VIII it is said: 'He who wishes to develop this meditation, should retreat to solitude, and whilst living secluded he should thus wisely reflect: 'Death will come to me! The vital energy will be cut off!' Or: 'Death! Death!' To him, namely, who does not wisely reflect, sorrow may arise by thinking on the death of a beloved person, just as to a mother whilst thinking on the death of her beloved child. Again, by reflecting on the death of a disliked person, joy may arise, just as to enemies whilst thinking on the death of their enemies. Through thinking on the death of an indifferent person, however, no emotion will arise, just as to a man whose work consists in cremating the dead at the sight of a dead body. And by reflecting on one's own death fright may arise... just as at the sight of a murderer with drawn sword one becomes filled with horror. Thus, whenever seeing here or there slain or other dead beings, one should reflect on the death of such deceased persons who once lived in happiness, and one should rouse one's attentiveness, emotion and knowledge and consider thus: 'Death will come, etc.'.... Only in him who considers in this way, will the hindrances (<i>nīvaraṇa</i>, q.v.) be repressed; and through the idea of death attention becomes steadfast, and the exercise reaches neighbourhood-concentration (<i>upacāra-samādhi</i>).\"<br><br>According to Vis.M. VIII, one may also reflect on death in the following various ways: one may think of it as a murderer with a drawn sword standing in front of oneself; or one may bear in mind that all happiness ends in death; or that even the mightiest beings on this earth are subject to death; or that we must share this body with all those innumerable worms and other tiny beings residing therein; or that life is something dependent on in-and-out breathing, and bound up with it; or that life continues only as long as the elements, food, breath, etc. are properly performing their functions; or that nobody knows when, where, and under what circumstances, death will take place, and what kind of fate we have to expect after death; or, that life is very short and limited. As it is said: 'Short, indeed, is this life of men, limited, fleeting, full or woe and torment; it is just like a dewdrop that vanishes as soon as the sun rises; like a water-bubble; like a furrow drawn in the water; like a torrent dragging everything along and never standing still; like cattle for slaughter that every moment look death in the face\" (A. VII, 74).<br><br>\"The monk devoted to this recollection of death is at all time indefatigable, gains the idea of disgust with regard to all forms of existence, gives up delight in life, detests evil, does not hoard up things, is free from stinginess with regard to the necessities of life, the idea of impermanence (<i>anicca</i>) becomes familiar to him; and through pursuing it, the idea of misery (<i>dukkha</i>) and of impersonality (<i>anattā</i>) become present to him.... Free from fear and bewilderment will he pass away at death; and should he not yet realize the Deathless State in his life-time, he will at the dissolution of the body attain to a happy course of existence\" (Vis.M. VIII).<br><br>See Buddhist Reflections on Death, by V. F. Guṇaratana (WHEEL 102/103). -Buddhism and Death, by M.Q.C. Walshe (WHEEL. 260)."

According to tradition, when the Bodhisatta was seated under the Bodhi-tree, Māra tried in vain to obstruct his attainment of Enlightenment, first by frightening him through his hosts of demons, etc., and then by his 3 daughters' allurements. This episode is called 'Māra's war' (māra-yuddha). For 7 years M. had followed the Buddha, looking for any weakness in him; that is, 6 years before the Enlightenment and one year after it (Sn. v. 446). He also tried to induce the Buddha to pass away into <i>Parinibbāna</i> without proclaiming the Dhamma, and also when the time for the Buddha's <i>Parinibbāna</i> had come, he urged him on.

        "'insight', is the intuitive light flashing forth and exposing the truth of the impermanency, the suffering and the impersonal and unsubstantial nature of all corporeal and mental phenomena of existence. It is insight-wisdom (<i>vipassanā-paññā</i>) that is the decisive liberating factor in Buddhism, though it has to be developed along with the 2 other trainings in morality and concentration. The culmination of insight practice (s. <i>visuddhi</i> VI) leads directly to the stages of holiness (s. <i>visuddhi</i> VII).<br><br>Insight is not the result of a mere intellectual understanding, but is won through direct meditative observation of one's own bodily and mental processes. In the commentaries and the Vis.M., the sequene in developing insight-meditation is given as follows: 1. discernment of the corporeal (<i>rūpa</i>), 2. of the mental (<i>nāma</i>), 3. contemplation of both (<i>nāmarūpa</i>; i.e. of their pairwise occurrence in actual events, and their interdependence), 4. both viewed as conditioned (application of the dependent origination, <i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i>), 5. application of the 3 characteristics (impermanency, etc.) to mind-and-body-cum-conditions.<br><br>The stages of gradually growing insight are described in the 9insight- knowledges (<i>vipassanā-ñāṇa</i>), constituting the 6th stage of purification: beginning with the 'knowledge of rise and fall' and ending with the 'adaptation to Truth'. For details, see <i>visuddhi</i> VI and Vis.M. XXI.<br><br>Eighteen chief kinds of insight-knowledge (or principal insights, mahā<i>-vipassanā</i>) are listed and described in Vis.M.

(5) of detachment (<i>virāgānupassanā</i>), (6) of extinction (<i>nirodhānupassanā</i>), (7) of abandoning (<i>paṭinissaggānupassanāā</i>), (8) of waning (<i>khayānupassanā</i>), (9) of vanishing (<i>vayānupassanā</i>), (10) of change (<i>vipariṇāmānupassanā</i>), (11) of the unconditioned (or signless, <i>animittānupassanā</i>), (12) of desirelessness (<i>apaṇihitānupassanā</i>), (13) of emptiness (<i>suññatāupassanā</i>), (14) insight into phenomena which is higher wisdom (<i>adhipaññā</i>-<i>dhamma-vipassanā</i>), (15) knowledge and vision according to reality (<i>yathā-bhūta-ñāṇadassana</i>), (16) contemplation of misery (or danger, <i>ādīnavānupassanā</i>), (17) reflecting contemplation (<i>paṭisaṅkhānupassanā</i>), (18) contemplation of turning away (<i>vivaṭṭanānupassanā</i>).<br><br>Through these 18, the adverse ideas and views are overcome, for which reason this way of overcoming is called 'overcoming by the opposite' (<i>tadaṅga-pahāna</i>, overcoming this factor by that).

        "This term has, according to its context, different shades of meaning, which should be carefully distinguished.<br><br>(I) To its most frequent usages (s. foll. 1-4) the general term 'formation' may be applied, with the qualifications required by the context. This term may refer either to the act of 'forming or to the passive state of 'having been formed' or to both.<br><br>1. As the 2nd link of the formula of dependent origination, (<i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i>, q.v.), <i>saṅkhāra</i> has the active aspect, 'forming, and signifies kamma (q.v.), i.e. wholesome or unwholesome volitional activity (<i>cetanā</i>) of body (<i>kāya-s.</i>), speech (<i>vacī-s.</i>) or mind (<i>citta-</i> or <i>mano-s.</i>). This definition occurs, e.g. at S. XII, 2, 27. For <i>s. </i>in this sense, the word 'kamma-formation' has been coined by the author. In other passages, in the same context,<i> s.</i> is defined by reference to (a) meritorious kamma-formations (<i>puññābhisaṅkhāra</i>), (b) demeritorious k. (<i>apuññabhisaṅkhāra</i>), (c) imperturbable k. (<i>āneñjābhisaṅkhāra</i>), e.g. in S. XII, 51; D. 33. This threefold division covers karmic activity in all spheres of existence: the meritorious kamma-formations extend to the sensuous and the fine-material sphere, the demeritorious ones only to the sensuous sphere, and the 'imperturbable' only to the immaterial sphere.<br><br>2. The aforementioned three terms, <i>kāya-</i>, <i>vacī-</i> and <i>citta-s.</i> are sometimes used in quite a different sense, namely as (1) bodily function, i.e. in-and-out-breathing (e.g. M. 10), (2) verbal function, i.e. thought-conception and discursive thinking, (3) mental-function, i.e. feeling and perception (e.g. M. 44). See <i>nirodhasamāpatti</i>.<br><br>3. It also denotes the 4th group of existence (<i>saṅkhārakkhandha</i>), and includes all 'mental formations' whether they belong to 'kammically forming' consciousness or not. See <i>khandha</i>, Tab. II. and S. XXII, 56, 79.<br><br>4. It occurs further in the sense of anything formed (<i>saṅkhata</i>, q.v.) and conditioned, and includes all things whatever in the world, all phenomena of existence. This meaning applies, e.g. to the well-known passage, \"All formations are impermanent... subject to suffering\" (<i>sabbe saṅkhāra aniccā</i>... <i>dukkhā</i>). In that context, however, <i>s.</i> is subordinate to the still wider and all-embracing term <i>dhamma</i> (thing); for <i>dhamma</i> includes also the Unformed or Unconditioned Element (<i>asaṅkhata-dhātu</i>), i.e. Nibbāna (e.g. in <i>sabbe</i> <i>dhammā</i> <i>anattā</i>, \"all things are without a self\").<br><br>(II) <i>Saṅkhāra</i> also means sometimes 'volitional effort', e.g. in the formula of the roads to power (<i>iddhi-pāda</i>, q.v.); in <i>sasaṅkhāra-</i> and <i>asaṅkhāra-parinibbāyī</i> (s. <i>Anāgāmī</i>, q.v.); and in the <i>Abhidhamma</i> terms <i>asaṅkhārika-</i> (q.v.) and s<i>asaṅkhārika-citta</i>, i.e. without effort = spontaneously, and with effort = prompted.<br><br>In Western literature, in English as well as in German, <i>saṅkhāra</i> is sometimes mistranslated by 'subconscious tendencies' or similarly (e.g Prof Beckh: \"unterbewußte Bildekräfte,\" i.e. subconscious formative forces). This misinterpretation derives perhaps from a similar usage in non-Buddhist Sanskrit literature, and is entirely inapplicable to the connotations of the term in <i>Pāḷi</i> Buddhism, as listed above under I, 1-4. For instance, within the dependent origination, s. is neither subconscious nor a mere tendency, but is a fully conscious and active karmic volition. In the context of the 5 groups of existence (s. above I, 3), a very few of the factors from the group of mental formations (<i>saṅkhārakkhandha</i>) are also present as concomitants of subconsciousness (s. Tab. I-III), but are of course not restricted to it, nor are they mere tendencies."

They are: the truth of suffering, of the origin of suffering, of the extinction of suffering, and of the Eightfold Path leading to the extinction of suffering.<br><br>I. The 1st truth, briefly stated, teaches that all forms of existence whatsoever are unsatisfactory and subject to suffering (<i>dukkha</i>).<br><br>II. The 2nd truth teaches that all suffering, and all rebirth, is produced by craving (<i>taṇhā</i>).<br><br>III. The 3rd truth teaches that extinction of craving necessarily results in extinction (<i>nirodha</i>) of rebirth and suffering, i.e. <i>Nibbāna</i> (q.v.).<br><br>IV. The 4th truth of the Eightfold Path (<i>magga</i>) indicates the means by which this extinction is attained.<br><br>The stereotype text frequently recurring in the <i>Sutta</i> <i>Piṭaka</i>, runs as follows:<br><br>I. \"But what, o monks, is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, decay is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair are suffering; in short, the 5 groups of existence connected with clinging are suffering (cf. <i>dukkha</i>, <i>dukkhata</i>).<br><br>II. ''But what, o monks, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? It is that craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth and, bound up with lust and greed, now here, now there, finds ever fresh delight. It is the sensual craving (<i>kāma-taṇhā</i>), the craving for existence (<i>bhava-taṇhā</i>), the craving for non-existence or self-annihilation (<i>vibhava-taṇhā</i>).<br><br>III. \"But what, o monks, is the noble truth of the extinction of suffering? It is the complete fading away and extinction of this craving, its forsaking and giving up, liberation and detachment from it.<br><br>IV. \"But what, o monks, is the noble truth of the path leading to the extinction of suffering? It is the Noble Eightfold Path (<i>ariya</i>-<i>aṭṭhaṅgika-magg</i><i>a</i>) that leads to the extinction of suffering, namely:<br><br><table border=\"1\" style=\"font-family:Tahoma; font-size:12px;\"><tr><td>1.

It is a mind free from sensual lust, ill-will and cruelty.<br><br>3. \"What now, o monks, is right speech?

Abstaining from injuring living beings, from stealing and from unlawful sexual intercourse (s. <i>kāmesu</i> <i>micchācāra</i>).<br><br>5. \"What now, o monks, is right livelihood? If the noble disciple rejects a wrong living, and gains his living by means of right livelihood (s. <i>magga</i>, 5).<br><br>6. \"What now, o monks, is right effort? If the disciple rouses his will to avoid the arising of evil, demeritorious things that have not yet arisen;... if he rouses his will to overcome the evil, demeritorious things that have already arisen;... if he rouses his will to produce meritorious things that have not yet arisen;... if he rouses his will to maintain the meritorious things that have already arisen and not to let them disappear, but to bring them to growth, to maturity and to the full perfection of development; he thus makes effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and strives (s. <i>padhāna</i>).<br><br>7. \"What now, o monks is right mindfulness? If the disciple dwells in contemplation of corporeality... of feeling... of mind... of the mind-objects, ardent, clearly conscious, and mindful after putting away worldly greed and grief (s. <i>Satipaṭṭhāna</i>).<br><br>8. \"What now, o monks, is right concentration? If the disciple is detached from sensual objects, detached from unwholesome things, and enters into the first absorption... the second absorption... the third absorption... the fourth absorption\" (s. <i>jhāna</i>).<br><br>In the Buddha's first sermon, the <i>Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</i>, it is said that the first truth (suffering) is to be fully understood; the second truth (craving) to be abandoned; the third truth (<i>Nibbāna</i>) to be realized; the fourth truth (the path) to be cultivated.<br><br>\"The truth of suffering is to be compared with a disease, the truth of the origin of suffering with the cause of the disease, the truth of extinction of suffering with the cure of the disease, the truth of the path with the medicine\" (Vis.M. XVI).<br><br>In the ultimate sense, all these 4 truths are to be considered as empty of a self, since there is no feeling agent, no doer, no liberated one. no one who follows along the path. Therefore it is said:<br><br>'Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found.<br><br>The deed is, but no doer of the deed is there.<br><br>Nibbāna is, but not the man that enters it.<br><br>The path is, but no traveller on it is seen.<br><br> <br><br>'The first truth and the second truth are empty<br><br>Of permanency, joy, of self and beauty;<br><br>The Deathless Realm is empty of an ego,<br><br>And free from permanency, joy and self, the path.'<br><br>(Vis.M. XVI) <br><br>It must be pointed out that the first truth does not merely refer to actual suffering, i.e. to suffering as feeling, but that it shows that, in consequence of the universal law of impermanency, all the phenomena of existence whatsoever, even the sublimest states of existence, are subject to change and dissolution, and hence are miserable and unsatisfactory; and that thus, without exception, they all contain in themselves the germ of suffering.

Thereby the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna</i> <i>Sutta</i> forms an illustration of the way in which these 4 contemplations relating to the 5 groups of existence (<i>khandha</i>, q.v.) simultaneously come to be realized, and finally lead to insight into the impersonality of all existence.<br><br>(1) The contemplation of the body (<i>kāyanupassanā</i>) consists of the following exercises: mindfulness with regard to in-and-outbreathing (<i>ānāpānasati </i>, q.v.), minding the 4 postures (<i>iriyāpatha</i>, q.v.), mindfulness and clarity of consciousness (<i>satisampajañña</i>, q.v.), reflection on the 32 parts of the body (s. <i>kāyagatāsati</i> and <i>asubha</i>), analysis of the 4 physical elements (<i>dhātuvavatthāna</i>, q.v.), cemetery meditations (<i>sīvathikā</i> q.v.).<br><br>(2) All feelings (<i>vedanānupassanā</i>) that arise in the meditator he clearly perceives, namely: agreeable and disagreeable feeling of body and mind, sensual and super-sensual feeling, indifferent feeling.<br><br>(3) He further clearly perceives and understands any state of consciousness or mind (<i>cittānupassanā</i>), whether it is greedy or not, hateful or not, deluded or not, cramped or distracted, developed or undeveloped, surpassable or unsurpassable, concentrated or unconcentrated, liberated or unliberated.<br><br>(4) Concerning the mind-objects (<i>dhammānupassanā</i>), he knows whether one of the five hindrances (<i>nīvaraṇa</i>, q.v.) is present in him or not, knows how it arises, how it is overcome, and how in future it does no more arise. He knows the nature of each of the five groups (<i>khandha</i>, q.v.), how they arise, and how they are dissolved. He knows the 12 bases of all mental activity (<i>āyatana</i> q.v.): the eye and the visual object, the ear and the audible object,.. mind and mind-object, he knows the fetters (<i>saṃyojana</i>, q.v.) based on them, knows how they arise, how they are overcome, and how in future they do no more arise. He knows whether one of the seven factors of enlightenment (<i>bojjhaṅga</i>, q.v.) is present in him or not, knows how it arises, and how it comes to full development. Each of the Four Noble Truths (<i>sacca</i>, q.v.) he understands according to reality.<br><br>The 4 contemplations comprise several exercises, but the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna </i>should not therefore be thought of as a mere collection of meditation subjects, any one of which may be taken out and practised alone. Though most of the exercises appear also elsewhere in the Buddhist scriptures, in the context of this <i>Sutta</i> they are chiefly intended for the cultivation of mindfulness and insight, as indicated by the repetitive passage concluding each section of the <i>Sutta</i> (see below). The 4 contemplations cover all the 5 groups of existence (<i>khandha</i>, q.v.), because mindfulness is meant to encompass the whole personality. Hence, for the full development of mindfulness, the practice should extend to all 4 types of contemplation, though not every single exercise mentioned under these four headings need be taken up. A methodical practice of <i>Satipaṭṭhāna </i>has to start with one of the exercises out of the group 'contemplation of the body', which will serve as the primary and regular subject of meditation: The other exercises of the group and the other contemplatons are to be cultivated when occasion for them arises during meditation and in everyday life.<br><br>After cach contemplation it is shown how it finally leads to insight-knowledge: \"Thus with regard to his own body he contemplates the body, with regard to the bodies of others he contemplates the body, with regard to both he contemplates the body. He beholds how the body arises and how it passes away, beholds the arising and passing away of the body. 'A body is there' (but no living being, no individual, no woman, no man, no self, nothing that belongs to a self; neither a person, nor anything belonging to a person; Com.): thus he has established his attentiveness as far as it serves his knowledge and mindfulness, and he lives independent, unattached to anything in the world.''<br><br>In the same way he contemplates feeling, mind and mind-objects.<br><br>In M. 118 it is shown how these four foundations of mindfulness may be brought about by the exercise of mindfulness on in-and-out breathing (<i>ānāpāna-sati</i>, q.v.).<br><br>Literature: The Way of Mindfullness, tr. of Sutta and Com., by Soma Thera (3rd ed; Kandy 1967, BPS). - The Heart of Buddhist Meditation, by Nyanaponika Thera (3rd ed.; London.

A Buddhist is said to have faith if \"he believes in the Perfect One's (the Buddha's) Enlightenment\" (M 53; A.V, 2), or in the Three Jewels (s. <i>ti-ratana</i>), by taking his refuge in them (s. <i>ti-saraṇa</i>). His faith, however, should be \"reasoned and rooted in understanding\" (<i>ākāravatī saddhā dassanamūlikā</i>; M. 47), and he is asked to investigate and test the object of his faith (M. 47, 95). A Buddhist's faith is not in conflict with the spirit of inquiry, and \"doubt about dubitable things\" (A. II, 65; S. XLII, 13) is admitted and inquiry into them is encouraged. The 'faculty of faith' (<i>saddhindriya</i>) should be balanced with that of wisdom (<i>paññindriya</i>; s. <i>indriya-samatta</i>). It is said: \"A monk who has understanding, establishes his faith in accordance with that understanding\" (S. XLVIII, 45). Through wisdom and understanding, faith becomes an inner certainty and firm conviction based on one's own experience.<br><br>Faith is called the seed (Sn. v. 77) of all wholesome states because, according to commentarial explanations, it inspires the mind with confidence (<i>okappana</i>, <i>pasāda</i>) and determination (<i>adhimokkha</i>), for 'launching out' (<i>pakkhandhana</i>; s. M. 122) to cross the flood of <i>saṃsāra </i>.<br><br>Unshakable faith is attained  on reaching the first stage of holiness, 'stream-entry' (<i>Sotāpatti</i>, s. <i>ariyapuggala</i>), when the fetter of sceptical doubt (<i>vicikicchā </i>; s. <i>saṃyojana</i>) is eliminated. Unshakable confidence (<i>avecca-pasāda</i>) in the Three Jewels is one of the characteristic qualities of the Stream-winner (<i>Sotāpannassa</i> <i>aṅgāni</i>, q.v.).<br><br>Faith is a mental concomitant, present in all kammically wholesome, and its corresponding neutral, consciousness (s. Tab. II). It is one of the 4 streams of merit (<i>puññadhārā</i>, q.v.), one of the 5 spiritual faculties (<i>indriya</i>, q.v.), spiritual powers (<i>bala</i>, q.v.), elements of exertion (<i>padhāniyaṅga</i>, q.v.) and one of the 7 treasures (<i>dhana </i>, q.v.).<br><br>See Faith in the Buddha's Teaching, by Soma Thera (WHEEL 262). \"Does Saddhā mean Faith?'' by Ñāṇamoli Thera (in WHEEL 52/53)."

Though as a distinct way of practice (s. <i>samatha-yānika</i>), it aims at the attainment of the meditative absorptions (<i>jhāna</i>, q.v.), a high degree of tranquil concentration (though not necessarily that of the absorptions) is indispensable for insight too. Tranquillity frees the mind from impurities and inner obstacles, and gives it greater penetrative strength.<br><br>''What now is the power of tranquillity (<i>samatha-bala</i>)? It is the one-pointedness and non-distraction of the mind due to freedom from desire (renunciation)... to freedom from ill-will... to the perception of light (s. <i>aloka-saññā</i>)... to non-distraction... to the defilling of phenomena... to knowledge, gladness, the 8 attainments, the 10 kasiṇas, the 10 recollections, the 9 cemetery contemplations, the 32 kinds of respiration-mindfulness... the one-pointedness and non-distraction of the mind of one contemplating abandonment (relinquishment) while inhaling and exhaling (s. <i>ānāpānasati </i>).<br><br>\"The power of tranquillity consists of the freedom from perturbation; in the 1st absorption, from the 5 hindrances (<i>nīvaraṇa</i>, (q.v.); in the 2nd absorption, from thought-conception and discursive thinking;... in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception it consists of the freedom from perturbation by the perception of the sphere of nothingness (s. <i>anupubbanirodha</i>), which is no longer agitated and irritated by defilements associated with restlessness, nor by the groups of existence\" (Pts.M. 1. p. 97)<br><br>(2) 'Insight' (s. <i>vipassanā</i>) is the penetrative understanding by direct meditative experience of the impermanency, unsatisfactoriness and impersonality of all material and mental phenomena of existence. It is insight that leads to entrance into the supermundance states of holiness and to final liberation.<br><br>''What now is the power of insight? It is the contemplation of impermanency (<i>aniccānupassanā</i>), of misery (<i>dukkhanupassanā</i>), impersonality' (<i>anattānupassanā</i>), of aversion (<i>nibbidanupassanā</i>), detachment (<i>virāganupassanā</i>), extinction (<i>nirodha</i>), ahandonment (<i>paṭinissaggānupassanā</i>), with regard to corporcality, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness.... That in contemplating the impermanency one is no more agitated by the idea of grasping... no more by ignorance and the defilements associated therewith and no more by the groups of existence: this is called the power of insight\" (Pts.M. p. 97).[Sīlakkhandhavagga-ṭīkā;...]<br><br>\"Two things are conducive to knowledge: tranquillity and insight.

All lust is abandoned.<br><br>\"If insight is developed, what profit does it bring? Wisdom is developed. If wisdom is developed, what profit does it bring? All ignorance is abandoned\" (A. II, 2.7).<br><br>There is a method of meditative practice where, in alternating sequence, tranquillity-meditation and insight-meditation are developed. It is called 'tranquillity and insight joined in pairs' (<i>samatha-vipassanāyuganaddha</i>), the coupling or yoking of tranquillity and insight. He who undertakes it, first enters into the 1st absorption. After rising from it, he contemplates the mental phenomena that were present in it (feeling, perception, etc.) as impermanent, painful and not-self, and thus he develops insight. Thereupon he enters into the 2nd absorption; and after rising from it, he again considers its constituent phenomena as impermanent, etc. In this way, he passes from one absorption to the next, until at last, during a moment of insight, the intuitive knowledge of the path (of Stream-entry, etc.) flashes forth - See A. IV, 170; A.IX, 36; Pts: <i>Yuganaddha Kathā</i>."

In that sense, as 'root-condition' (<i>hetu-paccaya</i>; s. <i>paccaya</i>), it is the first of the 24 conditions given in the introduction to the <i>Paṭṭhāna</i> (s. Guide, p. 117). The Dhs (1052-1082) and <i>Paṭṭhāna</i> (<i>Duka-paṭṭhāna</i>; Guide, p. 144) have sections on roots (<i>hetu</i>). - The term is also used (a) for the classification of consciousness, as <i>sa-hetuka </i>and <i>a-hetuka</i>, with and without concomitant root-conditions; (b) for a division of rebirth consciousness into <i>ahetuka</i>, <i>dvihetuka </i>and <i>tihetuka</i>, without, with 2, or with 3 root-conditions (s. <i>paṭisandhi</i>).<br><br><i>Ahetuka-diṭṭhi</i>, the false view of the uncausedness of existence; s. <i>diṭṭhi</i>."
